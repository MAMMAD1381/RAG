I see I have frightened you—sit down and tell me all the news.\"\n","\n","It was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna Pavlovna Scherer, maid of honour and favourite of the Empress Marya Fedorovna. With these words she greeted Prince Vasili Kuragin, a man of high rank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna Pavlovna had had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering from la grippe; grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used only by the elite.\n","\n","All her invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered by a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:\n","\n","\"If you have nothing better to do, Count [or Prince], and if the prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible, I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10—Annette Scherer.\"\n","\n","\"Heavens! what a virulent attack!\" replied the prince, not in the least disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing an embroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke in that refined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, and with the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance who had grown old in society and at court. He went up to Anna Pavlovna, kissed her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head, and complacently seated himself on the sofa.\n","\n","\"First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend’s mind at rest,\" said he without altering his tone, beneath the politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be discerned.\n","\n","\"Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times like these if one has any feeling?\" said Anna Pavlovna. \"You are staying the whole evening, I hope?\"\n","\n","\"And the fete at the English ambassador’s? Today is Wednesday. I must put in an appearance there,\" said the prince. \"My daughter is coming for me to take me there.\"\n","\n","\"I thought today’s fete had been cancelled. I confess all these festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.\"\n","\n","\"If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have been put off,\" said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by force of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed.\n","\n","\"Don’t tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novosiltsev’s dispatch? You know everything.\"\n","\n","\"What can one say about it?\" replied the prince in a cold, listless tone. \"What has been decided? They have decided that Buonaparte has burnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn ours.\"\n","\n","Prince Vasili always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a stale part. Anna Pavlovna Scherer on the contrary, despite her forty years, overflowed with animation and impulsiveness. To be an enthusiast had become her social vocation and, sometimes even when she did not feel like it, she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the expectations of those who knew her. The subdued smile which, though it did not suit her faded features, always played round her lips expressed, as in a spoiled child, a continual consciousness of her charming defect, which she neither wished, nor could, nor considered it necessary, to correct.\n","\n","In the midst of a conversation on political matters Anna Pavlovna burst out:\n","\n","\"The Empress is pregnant again. Bonaparte will leave all Europe without monarchs. He evidently has conceived that the French are to be an exclusive people. Perhaps he has met his former wife and repented of his sins. To-day no one would be surprised at any change in his plans.\"\n","\n","\"Bonaparte seems to have forgotten that there are laws of political economy. Princes should always remember this. Here is a curious fact. When I was in London there were two women of rank, both of whom I knew personally, who gave birth to sons at precisely the same time. One was at the age of forty, the other at thirty. The first son was delicate, small, and weak; the second was a veritable Hercules. It was all the difference of ten years. Now if you please, the same thing holds true of Europe. Bonaparte forgets that the sovereigns who rule Europe are men like other men. And I dare say if you examined the matter, you would find that the nations that are ruled by these sovereigns are just as susceptible to diseases, to shocks, to all the influences that weaken and ruin men. And I am convinced that Bonaparte, the genius, the man who is so great a personage in his own estimation, is merely an instrument of Providence who is now wreaking vengeance upon the sovereigns of Europe. I can assure you he is no more than that.\"\n","\n","Anna Pavlovna paused in her tirade and looked at Prince Vasili with a questioning smile.\n","\n","\"Well, what do you think?\" she asked, seeing that he had not stirred a muscle. \"Is there anything in what I say?\"\"\"\n","\n","# Anna Pavlovna Scherer was maid of honour and favourite of the Empress Marya Fedorovna.

She was, as she said, suffering from la grippe; grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used only by the elite.\n","\n","All her invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered by a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:\n","\n","\"If you have nothing better to do, Count [or Prince], and if the prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible, I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10—Annette Scherer.\"\n","\n","\"Heavens! what a virulent attack!\" replied the prince, not in the least disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing an embroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke in that refined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, and with the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance who had grown old in society and at court. He went up to Anna Pavlovna, kissed her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head, and complacently seated himself on the sofa.\n","\n","\"First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend’s mind at rest,\" said he without altering his tone, beneath the politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be discerned.\n","\n","\"Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times like these if one has any feeling?\" said Anna Pavlovna. \"You are staying the whole evening, I hope?\"\n","\n","\"And the fete at the English ambassador’s? Today is Wednesday. I must put in an appearance there,\" said the prince. \"My daughter is coming for me to take me there.\"\n","\n","\"I thought today’s fete had been cancelled. I confess all these festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.\"\n","\n","\"If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have been put off,\" said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by force of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed.\n","\n","\"Don’t tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novosiltsev’s dispatch? You know everything.\"\n","\n","\"What can one say about it?\" replied the prince in a cold, listless tone. \"What has been decided? They have decided that Buonaparte has burnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn ours.\"\n","\n","Prince Vasili always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a stale part. Anna Pavlovna Scherer on the contrary, despite her forty years, overflowed with animation and impulsiveness. To be an enthusiast had become her social vocation and, sometimes even when she did not feel like it, she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the expectations of those who knew her. The subdued smile which, though it did not suit her faded features, always played round her lips expressed, as in a spoiled child, a continual consciousness of her charming defect, which she neither wished, nor could, nor considered it necessary, to correct.\n","\n","In the midst of a conversation on political matters Anna Pavlovna burst out:\n","\n","\"The Empress is pregnant again. Bonaparte will leave all Europe without monarchs. He evidently has conceived that the French are to be an exclusive people. Perhaps he has met his former wife and repented of his sins. To-day no one would be surprised at any change in his plans.\"\n","\n","\"Bonaparte seems to have forgotten that there are laws of political economy. Princes should always remember this. Here is a curious fact. When I was in London there were two women of rank, both of whom I knew personally, who gave birth to sons at precisely the same time. One was at the age of forty, the other at thirty. The first son was delicate, small, and weak; the second was a veritable Hercules. It was all the difference of ten years. Now if you please, the same thing holds true of Europe. Bonaparte forgets that the sovereigns who rule Europe are men like other men. And I dare say if you examined the matter, you would find that the nations that are ruled by these sovereigns are just as susceptible to diseases, to shocks, to all the influences that weaken and ruin men. And I am convinced that Bonaparte, the genius, the man who is so great a personage in his own estimation, is merely an instrument of Providence who is now wreaking vengeance upon the sovereigns of Europe. I can assure you he is no more than that.\"\n","\n","Anna Pavlovna paused in her tirade and looked at Prince Vasili with a questioning smile.\n","\n","\"Well, what do you think?\" she asked, seeing that he had not stirred a muscle. \"Is there anything in what I say?\"\"\"\n","\n","summarizer = T5_Summarizer(load_online=True)\n","summary = summarizer.summarize_text(context)\n","print(summary)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"mx1GETenIlr_","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1717801014948,"user_tz":-210,"elapsed":101112,"user":{"displayName":"mohammad mohammdian","userId":"16778632015796518458"}},"outputId":"8a6d92e4-0547-4419-98d4-fbf7a18af536"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["Special tokens have been added in the vocabulary, make sure the associated word embeddings are fine-tuned or trained.\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":[": \"The Empress is pregnant again.

2024 12:27:45 obtaining high-efﬁciency red, green, and blue LEDs using InGaN/GaN semiconductors is further paving way for new applications.7–9 One of the most widely anticipated applications of microLEDs and RGB capability is in next-generation self-emissive display technol- ogy.10,11 The adoption of microLEDs in display devices is expected to enable much brighter, broader color gamut, longer lifetime, and extremely high pixels per inch (PPI) displays A number of these char- acteristics are especially highly desirable in displays for augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications There are multiple next-generation display demonstrations in the commercial sector Samsung demonstrated a microLED display of 292 inches at CES 2020.12 Jade Bird has demonstrated a microdisplay of 0.3 in with 5000 PPI for AR/VR applications.13 Recently, Compound Photonics unveiled a microdisplay with a record resolution of 8424 PPI.14 The wide interest from the commercial sector to push for the next genera- tion of display technologies using microLEDs has propelled the research effort into improving the key microLED characteristics such as efﬁciency, brightness, full-color emission, and lifetime While microLEDs have been receiving signiﬁcant commercial interest for their use as emitters for display technology, little commer- cial focus has been applied to microLEDs for non-display applications, which is an active area of research (see Fig 1) While high information content displays require a high resolution and small pixels, which can lead to challenges including reduced efﬁciency due to greater non- radiative recombination, higher current density, and degraded extrac- tion,15–18 many of the reviewed non-display applications can beneﬁt from single pixel control and take advantage of relatively efﬁcient, larger pixels Future applications, especially in areas that beneﬁt from ultra-small (e.g., sub micrometer) LEDs, experience some of these challenges and are brieﬂy also discussed MicroLEDs are increasingly being used as a signal emitter in visible light communication (VLC) systems due to their high modulation bandwidth and ability to offer parallel channels for communication using microLED array.19–21 MicroLEDs are also well-suited for optogenetic stimulation, requiring a spatially resolved high-intensity light source.22–24 Multiple computa- tional microscopy techniques, such as structured illumination micros- copy (SIM), for neural imaging have also used microLEDs as light sources.25,26 The high intensity emission in the UV-blue spectrum also makes microLEDs suitable for maskless lithography.27 These non- display applications often require modiﬁcation in the electro-optical characteristics of microLEDs Performance characteristics such as modulation bandwidth, light output power, emission wavelength, and extraction efﬁciency are tailored by integrating additional optical and electrical structures (see Fig 1) The fabrication of the optical struc- tures requires more processing on the top of the microLED structure Despite the progress in fabrication capabilities, a number of challenges remain to be addressed for these applications In this review, we explore microLED electro-optical characteris- tics needed for non-display applications We ﬁrst discuss multiple non-display application areas highlighting key past results and ongo- ing research work We then examine the performance metrics critical for the non-display applications', 'This would require scaling down microLEDs further along and improving external efﬁciency to be able to deliver enough light irradiation to create action potentials The mesa size-related efﬁciency droop needs to be further improved Closed loop stimulation and monitoring of a large ensemble of neu- rons would require large-scale device fabrication Integration with microLED drivers and electrode arrays also needs to be addressed As microLEDs are scaled down to the nanoscale, they will have the potential for an entirely new concept of microscopy, NIM with resolu- tion capabilities surpassing the diffraction limit However, as the microLEDs are miniaturized to nanoscale dimensions, increased non- radiative recombination due to the larger surface-to-volume ratio of the mesa becomes a challenge.15,16 Various mesa sidewall passivation methods, such as dielectric (e.g., SiO2, Al2O3) deposition using plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) and atomic layer deposition (ALD), acid-base etching, hydrogen plasma, and sul- fur treatments, are suggested ways to minimize non-radiative recombi- nation and improve the external quantum efﬁciency.258–261 Progress toward improving the extraction efﬁciency of LEDs using photonic crystals and beam shaping using microlenses has been made, but challenges related to reliable integration with microLEDs remain to be addressed The most common microlens fabrication technique (as the reﬂow method) faces uniformity and control chal- lenges that need to be improved The fabrication of high-quality opti- cal microlenses to minimize scattering is also a challenge Photonic crystal fabrication often requires using electron beam lithography which is expensive and offers a low throughput Simpler and more reliable fabrication techniques need to be developed for further inte- gration with microLEDs and to enable more widespread utilization of these advanced methods The ability to modify the electro-optical properties of microLEDs using various techniques has the potential to enable even more appli- cations beyond displays MicroLEDs can be used further as active ele- ments in chemical sensors for environmental monitoring and optically activating gas sensors to enable room temperature gas sensing.262–264 The potential of microLEDs as a light source for various computa- tional microscopy techniques further remains to be explored More research into eliminating size-scaling related efﬁciency droop as well as compatibility and integration with silicon processing needs to be undertaken to further reduce cost and improve integration These advances will give a much-needed boost to

extraordinary combination of high luminance, high energy efﬁciency, low cost, and long lifetime These characteristics are highly desirable in various applications, but their usage has, to date, been primarily focused toward next-generation display technologies Applications of microLEDs in other technologies, such as projector systems, computational imaging, communication systems, or neural stim- ulation, have been limited In non-display applications which use microLEDs as light sources, modiﬁcations in key electrical and optical char- acteristics such as external efﬁciency, output beam shape, modulation bandwidth, light output power, and emission wavelengths are often needed for optimum performance A number of advanced fabrication and processing techniques have been used to achieve these electro- optical characteristics in microLEDs In this article, we review the non-display application areas of the microLEDs, the distinct opto- electrical characteristics required for these applications, and techniques that integrate the optical and electrical components on the microLEDs to improve system-level efﬁcacy and performance Published under an exclusive license by AIP

automobiles, smartphones, home lighting systems, and industrial lighting.1–5 The adoption of LEDs has enabled additional functionalities in the form of longer life- time, more reliable operation, smaller form factor, and lower power consumption in almost every application Much of the effort toward cost reduction in LEDs has been focused on increasing external efﬁciency using improved material growth techniques and optimizing fabrication processes.6 The reduc- tion in high costs of GaN semiconductor-based light emitting diodes is a challenge that needs to be addressed', 'This changes the

low-temperature growth.249 Various fabrication techniques, such as strain engineering, lower growth rates, and high growth temperatures, are required to tackle the low EQE problem facing III-nitride based red microLEDs.250 A more detailed review of the development of red microLEDs can be found in the manuscript from Iida et al.250 Apart from applications in display technologies, the development of different colored efﬁcient microLEDs is important for other applica- tions such as optogenetics The activation or suppression of different cells expressed by different proteins is highly desirable for more precise control over the neuronal activity Red-and-blue-colored microLED-based optoelectronic probes have been used to demonstrate bi-directional neuronal activity manipulation.251,252 Dual-colored microLED arrays have also been used as VLC transmitters and dem- onstrated error-free data rates of 1.79–3.35 Gbps in a dual-wavelength multiplexing scheme.253 Further work is needed to enhance the efﬁ- ciency of longer wavelength microLEDs as longer wavelengths enable deeper neural cell stimulation in optogenetics and wavelength division multiplexing in VLC systems.254,255 V OUTLOOK AND CHALLENGES As discussed in the article, MicroLED/LED technology has been incorporated into a range of applications beyond display applications MicroLEDs based on InGaN/GaN have consistently higher efﬁciencies than competing approaches even as we scale down the device dimen- sions to sub-micron size for blue, green, and red emissions The efﬁ- ciency of the red-colored InGaN/GaN microLEDs can stand further improvement, especially at smaller dimensions The ability to achieve RGB emission from a single material stack will open a wide array of applications with increasingly complex system integration Additionally, the relatively high cost of GaN epi wafers remains a chal- lenge to be addressed, as microLED technology is adopted into a greater number of applications such as point-of-care medical applica- tions like phototherapy and skin treatments.256,257 The adoption of microLEDs in visible light communication (VLC) systems has rapidly grown with improved data transfer rates An increase in the modulation bandwidth is the driving factor for the higher data transfer rates Device miniaturization and the decrease in carrier lifetime of microLEDs can further improve this trend Additionally, VLC systems that use an array of microLEDs as emitters have the potential to enhance the data transfer rates even higher, albeit with the increased system complexity Implementation of VLC in lab- oratory setup is routinely demonstrated, but the real-life system still remains a challenge Many critical issues such as reliability, scalability, and compactness related to the commercialization of the VLC systems remain to be addressed As optogenetics advances our understanding of neural circuits, microLEDs will have an increasingly prevalent role in delivering spa- tially resolved single-neuron stimulation', '(c) Ray-tracing simulation of an illumination system with a free- form optics design The illumination area for simulation is 10 \\x02 20 m2, and the light source

microLEDs could enable a single- colored pixel to emit multiple colors.207,208 All three methods to achieve different wavelength emissions are discussed in this section Other techniques such as quantum well (QW) thickness-dependent InGaN/GaN multiple quantum wells (MQW), microfacet emission from MQW, nanowires, and local strain engineering have also been explored in the literature for wavelength tuning in microLEDs.209–213 1 Colloidal Quantum Dots (QDs) QDs are nanoscale semiconductor crystals with distinct proper- ties from those of bulk semiconductors.214,215 Each QD consists of a small inorganic semiconductor core (1–10 nm), a wider-bandgap semiconductor shell, and a coating of passivating ligands.216,217 An atomic force microscopy (AFM) height image of a closely packed monolayer of QDs is shown in Fig 15(c) One of the most useful prop- erties of these nanocrystals is the tunability of their bandgap by varying their size and discrete energy levels also called the quantum conﬁned effect.215,218 Figure 15(a) shows QD solutions of various sizes and composition exhibiting photoluminescence under UV light Figure 15(b) shows the PL spectra of QDs with narrowband emission from visible to NIR Several advantageous properties of QDs such as narrow emission linewidth (20–30 nm for CdSe), high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY > 90%), high photostability, and solution processability make them attractive for applications with microLEDs.126,219 CdSe, with an emission linewidth of 20–30 nm, and PbS are the most commonly used materials for the core of the QDs for visible wavelength and NIR devices, respectively.214,220,221 As mentioned in the application section, microLEDs are used in VLC systems to achieve higher bandwidth and data transfer speeds This has motivated the adoption of white light microLEDs with larger pixel sizes of 100 lm into VLC systems to achieve higher data transfer rates without complicated signal processing.120 As a result, it has become essential to ﬁnd a white light source with wavelength multi- plexing ability for VLC systems Recently, researchers have explored QD-based white light microLEDs for VLC applications Mei et al demonstrated a white light system that used Perovskite QDs for a high bandwidth VLC system.124 They showed 80 \\x02 80 lm2 microLEDs having a modulation bandwidth of 160 MHz and a peak emission wavelength of approximately 445 nm', 'Deﬁnitions of the key metrics from a non-display application point of view are presented We also highlight optical structures such as photonic crystals,

microLEDs.148–152 This section discusses the techniques for extraction efﬁciency enhancement in the context of various non-display applications 1 Photonic crystals Photonic crystals (PhCs) are repeated dielectric structures of length scales similar to the wavelength of light.148,153,154 These crystals have the capability to modify spontaneous light emission by creating a photonic bandgap that can interact with the electronic bandgap of the emission material.155 The photonic bandgap can be utilized in two ways to increase the extraction efﬁciency: inhibiting the emission of the guided modes or redirecting trapped light into radiated modes The photonic crystals should be physically very close to the active light emitting region to maximize their impact Wierer et al demonstrated electrically operated InGaN/GaN LEDs with photonic crystals having a tunnel junction to provide lateral current spreading to the photonics crystals.154 This work reports increased microLED radiance and an approximately 1.5x total increase in light extraction with photonic crystals incorporation Additionally, the far-ﬁeld radiation pattern of LEDs with PhC was also radically different than planar

quantum efﬁciencies (IQEs) that can exceed ninety percent as a result of advances in growth techniques that have yielded high-quality materials and crystal structures.100–103 However, the external quantum efﬁciency (EQE) of GaN-based microLEDs, deﬁned as the ratio of the number of photons emitted vs the number of photons internally generated, is comparatively low with a peak EQE of generally smaller than 15%.104–106 The EQE of the microLEDs can be viewed as the product of two separate efﬁciencies: IQE and light extraction efﬁciency (LEE).107 While IQE is signiﬁcantly improved over the years, LEE has been a limiting factor.100,108,109 Low LEE is primarily due to the large refractive index difference between air and semiconductors that traps light from total internal reﬂection (TIR) and Fresnel loss at the interface.110 For example, the external efﬁciency could be as low as 4.3% in a typical semiconductor material with a refractive index of 2.4', 'reported a white light VLC system that used semi-polar blue microLEDs and yellow phosphors to achieve a data rate of 2.805 Gbps.128 The higher data rate and band- width of the system are attributed to the improved radiative efﬁciency of the semi-polar blue microLEDs resulting from the reduced quantum-conﬁned Stark effect (QCSE) A hybrid strategy of mixing small-sized and large-sized phos- phors can improve the non-uniformity of the system to a great extent with only a small reduction in efﬁciency However, this remains a chal- lenge as mesa dimensions shrink to smaller areas of 5 l m and below.204 Recently, GE has developed a sub-micron sized red phos- phor K2SiF6:Mn4þ (KSF) and KSF inks suitable for microLEDs that can be deposited by low-cost methods such as ink-jet printing, slot die coating, or spin coating.233 These recent developments pave the way for phosphors to be further utilized in microLED applications by over- coming challenges due to their size 3 Compound semiconductor layers Electroluminescence, which is responsible for spontaneous light emission upon the passage of electric current, dates back to 1907 when Round discovered it in silicon carbide (SiC) crystals.234 Further under- standing of materials and luminescent phenomena makes tuning of bandgap an obvious choice for the creation of light emitting diodes of different colors.235–238 Red LEDs have traditionally used AlGaInP crystals, but recent focus has shifted to indium gallium nitride (InGaN) crystals as they offer a wide spectral range from ultraviolet to infrared.239 InGaN bandgap energy can be tuned from 0.67 to 3.42 eV by changing the composition of the alloy.129,240,241 Figure 17 shows the energy bandgap of hexagonal gallium nitride (h-GaN) as a func- tion of lattice constant that is controlled by the indium (In) concentra- tion in the alloy The external quantum efﬁciency (EQE) of the microLED decreases with decreasing device size due to the increased non- radiative recombination, also known as efﬁciency droop.100 While the peak EQE of a 20 \\x02 20 lm blue microLED has been reported to be as high as 33%, AlGaInP-based red microLEDs suffer signiﬁcantly from efﬁciency droop due to high surface recombination and long carrier lifetime at smaller dimensions (<50 lm).242–244 They also suffer from poor thermal stability at high temperatures.245,246 This has resulted in a growing interest in creating red microLEDs that are based on III- nitride materials, in particular InGaN.247,248 The EQE of red InGaN FIG 16 Phosphor structure and emission spectrum (a) The crystal structure of a nar-

high-efﬁciency red, green, and blue LEDs using InGaN/GaN semiconductors is further paving way for new applications.7–9 One of the most widely anticipated applications of microLEDs and RGB capability is in next-generation self-emissive display technol- ogy.10,11 The adoption of microLEDs in display devices is expected to enable much brighter, broader color gamut, longer lifetime, and extremely high pixels per inch (PPI) displays A number of these char- acteristics are especially highly desirable in displays for augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications There are multiple next-generation display demonstrations in the commercial sector Samsung demonstrated a microLED display of 292 inches at CES 2020.12 Jade Bird has demonstrated a microdisplay of 0.3 in with 5000 PPI for AR/VR applications.13 Recently, Compound Photonics unveiled a microdisplay with a record resolution of 8424 PPI.14 The wide interest from the commercial sector to push for the next genera- tion of display technologies using microLEDs has propelled the research effort into improving the key microLED characteristics such as efﬁciency, brightness, full-color emission, and lifetime While microLEDs have been receiving signiﬁcant commercial interest for their use as emitters for display technology, little commer- cial focus has been applied to microLEDs for non-display applications, which is an active area of research (see Fig 1) While high information content displays require a high resolution and small pixels, which can lead to challenges including reduced efﬁciency due to greater non- radiative recombination, higher current density, and degraded extrac- tion,15–18 many of the reviewed non-display applications can beneﬁt from single pixel control and take advantage of relatively efﬁcient, larger pixels Future applications, especially in areas that beneﬁt from ultra-small (e.g., sub micrometer) LEDs, experience some of these challenges and are brieﬂy also discussed MicroLEDs are increasingly being used as a signal emitter in visible light communication (VLC) systems due to their high modulation bandwidth and ability to offer parallel channels for communication using microLED array.19–21 MicroLEDs are also well-suited for optogenetic stimulation, requiring a spatially resolved high-intensity light source.22–24 Multiple computa- tional microscopy techniques, such as structured illumination micros- copy (SIM), for neural imaging have also used microLEDs as light sources.25,26 The high intensity emission in the UV-blue spectrum also makes microLEDs suitable for maskless lithography.27 These non- display applications often require modiﬁcation in the electro-optical characteristics of microLEDs Performance characteristics such as modulation bandwidth, light output power, emission wavelength, and extraction efﬁciency are tailored by integrating additional optical and electrical structures (see Fig 1) The fabrication of the optical struc- tures requires more processing on the top of the microLED structure Despite the progress in fabrication capabilities, a number of challenges remain to be addressed for these applications In this review, we explore microLED electro-optical characteris- tics needed for non-display applications We ﬁrst discuss multiple non-display application areas highlighting key past results and ongo- ing research work We then examine the performance metrics critical for the non-display applications', 'This would require scaling down microLEDs further along and improving external efﬁciency to be able to deliver enough light irradiation to create action potentials The mesa size-related efﬁciency droop needs to be further improved Closed loop stimulation and monitoring of a large ensemble of neu- rons would require large-scale device fabrication Integration with microLED drivers and electrode arrays also needs to be addressed As microLEDs are scaled down to the nanoscale, they will have the potential for an entirely new concept of microscopy, NIM with resolu- tion capabilities surpassing the diffraction limit However, as the microLEDs are miniaturized to nanoscale dimensions, increased non- radiative recombination due to the larger surface-to-volume ratio of the mesa becomes a challenge.15,16 Various mesa sidewall passivation methods, such as dielectric (e.g., SiO2, Al2O3) deposition using plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) and atomic layer deposition (ALD), acid-base etching, hydrogen plasma, and sul- fur treatments, are suggested ways to minimize non-radiative recombi- nation and improve the external quantum efﬁciency.258–261 Progress toward improving the extraction efﬁciency of LEDs using photonic crystals and beam shaping using microlenses has been made, but challenges related to reliable integration with microLEDs remain to be addressed The most common microlens fabrication technique (as the reﬂow method) faces uniformity and control chal- lenges that need to be improved The fabrication of high-quality opti- cal microlenses to minimize scattering is also a challenge Photonic crystal fabrication often requires using electron beam lithography which is expensive and offers a low throughput Simpler and more reliable fabrication techniques need to be developed for further inte- gration with microLEDs and to enable more widespread utilization of these advanced methods The ability to modify the electro-optical properties of microLEDs using various techniques has the potential to enable even more appli- cations beyond displays MicroLEDs can be used further as active ele- ments in chemical sensors for environmental monitoring and optically activating gas sensors to enable room temperature gas sensing.262–264 The potential of microLEDs as a light source for various computa- tional microscopy techniques further remains to be explored More research into eliminating size-scaling related efﬁciency droop as well as compatibility and integration with silicon processing needs to be undertaken to further reduce cost and improve integration These advances will give a much-needed boost to the InGaN/GaN based microLED technology and

techniques, such as strain engineering, lower growth rates, and high growth temperatures, are required to tackle the low EQE problem facing III-nitride based red microLEDs.250 A more detailed review of the development of red microLEDs can be found in the manuscript from Iida et al.250 Apart from applications in display technologies, the development of different colored efﬁcient microLEDs is important for other applica- tions such as optogenetics The activation or suppression of different cells expressed by different proteins is highly desirable for more precise control over the neuronal activity Red-and-blue-colored microLED-based optoelectronic probes have been used to demonstrate bi-directional neuronal activity manipulation.251,252 Dual-colored microLED arrays have also been used as VLC transmitters and dem- onstrated error-free data rates of 1.79–3.35 Gbps in a dual-wavelength multiplexing scheme.253 Further work is needed to enhance the efﬁ- ciency of longer wavelength microLEDs as longer wavelengths enable deeper neural cell stimulation in optogenetics and wavelength division multiplexing in VLC systems.254,255 V OUTLOOK AND CHALLENGES As discussed in the article, MicroLED/LED technology has been incorporated into a range of applications beyond display applications MicroLEDs based on InGaN/GaN have consistently higher efﬁciencies than competing approaches even as we scale down the device dimen- sions to sub-micron size for blue, green, and red emissions The efﬁ- ciency of the red-colored InGaN/GaN microLEDs can stand further improvement, especially at smaller dimensions The ability to achieve RGB emission from a single material stack will open a wide array of applications with increasingly complex system integration Additionally, the relatively high cost of GaN epi wafers remains a chal- lenge to be addressed, as microLED technology is adopted into a greater number of applications such as point-of-care medical applica- tions like phototherapy and skin treatments.256,257 The adoption of microLEDs in visible light communication (VLC) systems has rapidly grown with improved data transfer rates An increase in the modulation bandwidth is the driving factor for the higher data transfer rates Device miniaturization and the decrease in carrier lifetime of microLEDs can further improve this trend Additionally, VLC systems that use an array of microLEDs as emitters have the potential to enhance the data transfer rates even higher, albeit with the increased system complexity Implementation of VLC in lab- oratory setup is routinely demonstrated, but the real-life system still remains a challenge Many critical issues such as reliability, scalability, and compactness related to the commercialization of the VLC systems remain to be addressed As optogenetics advances our understanding of neural circuits, microLEDs will have an increasingly prevalent role in delivering spa- tially resolved single-neuron stimulation',

modiﬁes the bandgap of the semiconductor In addition to modifying the lattice constant of the material, adding quantum dots (QD) or phosphors to the mesa surface of microLEDs could enable a single- colored pixel to emit multiple colors.207,208 All three methods to achieve different wavelength emissions are discussed in this section Other techniques such as quantum well (QW) thickness-dependent InGaN/GaN multiple quantum wells (MQW), microfacet emission from MQW, nanowires, and local strain engineering have also been explored in the literature for wavelength tuning in microLEDs.209–213 1 Colloidal Quantum Dots (QDs) QDs are nanoscale semiconductor crystals with distinct proper- ties from those of bulk semiconductors.214,215 Each QD consists of a small inorganic semiconductor core (1–10 nm), a wider-bandgap semiconductor shell, and a coating of passivating ligands.216,217 An atomic force microscopy (AFM) height image of a closely packed monolayer of QDs is shown in Fig 15(c) One of the most useful prop- erties of these nanocrystals is the tunability of their bandgap by varying their size and discrete energy levels also called the quantum conﬁned effect.215,218 Figure 15(a) shows QD solutions of various sizes and composition exhibiting photoluminescence under UV light Figure 15(b) shows the PL spectra of QDs with narrowband emission from visible to NIR Several advantageous properties of QDs such as narrow emission linewidth (20–30 nm for CdSe), high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY > 90%), high photostability, and solution processability make them attractive for applications with microLEDs.126,219 CdSe, with an emission linewidth of 20–30 nm, and PbS are the most commonly used materials for the core of the QDs for visible wavelength and NIR devices, respectively.214,220,221 As mentioned in the application section, microLEDs are used in VLC systems to achieve higher bandwidth and data transfer speeds This has motivated the adoption of white light microLEDs with larger pixel sizes of 100 lm into VLC systems to achieve higher data transfer rates without complicated signal processing.120 As a result, it has become essential to ﬁnd a white light source with wavelength multi- plexing ability for VLC systems Recently, researchers have explored QD-based white light microLEDs for VLC applications Mei et al demonstrated a white light system that used Perovskite QDs for a high bandwidth VLC system.124 They showed 80 \\x02 80 lm2 microLEDs having a modulation bandwidth of 160 MHz and a peak emission wavelength of approximately 445

is still notably low because increasing indium (In) content in the alloy degrades crystal quality due to a large lattice mismatch and low-temperature growth.249 Various fabrication techniques, such as strain engineering, lower growth rates, and high growth temperatures, are required to tackle the low EQE problem facing III-nitride based red microLEDs.250 A more detailed review of the development of red microLEDs can be found in the manuscript from Iida et al.250 Apart from applications in display technologies, the development of different colored efﬁcient microLEDs is important for other applica- tions such as optogenetics The activation or suppression of different cells expressed by different proteins is highly desirable for more precise control over the neuronal activity Red-and-blue-colored microLED-based optoelectronic probes have been used to demonstrate bi-directional neuronal activity manipulation.251,252 Dual-colored microLED arrays have also been used as VLC transmitters and dem- onstrated error-free data rates of 1.79–3.35 Gbps in a dual-wavelength multiplexing scheme.253 Further work is needed to enhance the efﬁ- ciency of longer wavelength microLEDs as longer wavelengths enable deeper neural cell stimulation in optogenetics and wavelength division multiplexing in VLC systems.254,255 V OUTLOOK AND CHALLENGES As discussed in the article, MicroLED/LED technology has been incorporated into a range of applications beyond display applications MicroLEDs based on InGaN/GaN have consistently higher efﬁciencies than competing approaches even as we scale down the device dimen- sions to sub-micron size for blue, green, and red emissions The efﬁ- ciency of the red-colored InGaN/GaN microLEDs can stand further improvement, especially at smaller dimensions The ability to achieve RGB emission from a single material stack will open a wide array of applications with increasingly complex system integration Additionally, the relatively high cost of GaN epi wafers remains a chal- lenge to be addressed, as microLED technology is adopted into a greater number of applications such as point-of-care medical applica- tions like phototherapy and skin treatments.256,257 The adoption of microLEDs in visible light communication (VLC) systems has rapidly grown with improved data transfer rates An increase in the modulation bandwidth is the driving factor for the higher data transfer rates Device miniaturization and the decrease in carrier lifetime of microLEDs can further improve this trend Additionally, VLC systems that use an array of microLEDs as emitters have the potential to enhance the data transfer rates even higher, albeit with the increased system complexity Implementation of VLC in lab- oratory setup is routinely demonstrated, but the real-life system still remains a challenge Many critical issues such as reliability, scalability, and compactness related to the commercialization of the VLC systems remain to be addressed As optogenetics advances our understanding of neural circuits, microLEDs will have an increasingly prevalent role in delivering spa- tially resolved single-neuron stimulation', 'OPTICAL STRUCTURES FOR IMPROVED PERFORMANCE Despite the superior performance of microLEDs when compared with OLEDs, modiﬁcation in the key properties of microLEDs is often required for non-display applications Electro-optical components such as photonic crystals, nanostructures, microlenses, Fresnel lenses, quantum dots, phosphors, etc., are integrated with the traditional microLEDs to improve the output performance Key optical compo- nents that can enhance the performance metrics of microLEDs and make them more suitable for use in non-display applications are dis- cussed in Secs IVA–V A Extraction efficiency enhancement The low extraction efﬁciency of microLEDs originates from the traditionally grown epilayer structure of the GaN LEDs.6,106,144 A typi- cal GaN epi structure is grown hetero-epitaxially on a sapphire sub- strate due to the lack of availability of a suitable substrate for homoepitaxial growth.145,146 The photons generated inside the GaN FIG 9 A graph showing the

of the extracted light.147 Researchers have suggested methods including chip shaping, photonic crystals, surface roughness, and mesa shape modiﬁcation to improve the extraction efﬁciency of microLEDs.148–152 This section discusses the techniques for extraction efﬁciency enhancement in the context of various non-display applications 1 Photonic crystals Photonic crystals (PhCs) are repeated dielectric structures of length scales similar to the wavelength of light.148,153,154 These crystals have the capability to modify spontaneous light emission by creating a photonic bandgap that can interact with the electronic bandgap of the emission material.155 The photonic bandgap can be utilized in two ways to increase the extraction efﬁciency: inhibiting the emission of the guided modes or redirecting trapped light into radiated modes The photonic crystals should be physically very close to the active light emitting region to maximize their impact Wierer et al demonstrated electrically operated InGaN/GaN LEDs with photonic crystals having a tunnel junction to provide lateral current spreading to the photonics crystals.154 This work reports increased microLED radiance and an approximately 1.5x total increase in light extraction with photonic crystals incorporation Additionally, the far-ﬁeld radiation pattern of LEDs with PhC was also radically different than planar LEDs.154 Oder et al demonstrated extraction efﬁciency enhancement of 63% in InGaN/GaN blue (460 nm) microLEDs and 95% in AlInGaN/ GaN UV (340 nm) microLEDs', 'further advanced the tech- nique by combining a CMOS-controlled microLED array with a projection system and translation stage to achieve written features as small as 8 lm.27 Building further on the same setup, Guilhabert et al reported mask-fee direct pattern writing with features as small as 500 nm by primarily modifying the projection optics.96 They also showed the fabrication of InGaN micro-LEDs using the same setup Recently, Wu

diodes (OLEDs) for key properties such as brightness, response time, and lifetime Table II summarizes the performance comparison between the microLEDs and OLED technology.99 Many of the metrics, such as superior brightness, reliability, and lifetime, make microLEDs well-suited to both display and non-display, but some of the key performance metrics for non-display applications dif- fer from those for display applications This section discusses the key performance parameters of microLEDs that must be optimized or enhanced for non-display applications These metrics include optical extraction,

quantum efﬁciencies (IQEs) that can exceed ninety percent as a result of advances in growth techniques that have yielded high-quality materials and crystal structures.100–103 However, the external quantum efﬁciency (EQE) of GaN-based microLEDs, deﬁned as the ratio of the number of photons emitted vs the number of photons internally generated, is comparatively low with a peak EQE of generally smaller than 15%.104–106 The EQE of the microLEDs can be viewed as the product of two separate efﬁciencies: IQE and light extraction efﬁciency (LEE).107 While IQE is signiﬁcantly improved over the years, LEE has been a limiting factor.100,108,109 Low LEE is primarily due to the large refractive index difference between air and semiconductors that traps light from total internal reﬂection (TIR) and Fresnel loss at the interface.110 For example, the external efﬁciency could be as low as 4.3% in a typical semiconductor material with a refractive index of 2.4', 'reported a white light VLC system that used semi-polar blue microLEDs and yellow phosphors to achieve a data rate of 2.805 Gbps.128 The higher data rate and band- width of the system are attributed to the improved radiative efﬁciency of the semi-polar blue microLEDs resulting from the reduced quantum-conﬁned Stark effect (QCSE) A hybrid strategy of mixing small-sized and large-sized phos- phors can improve the non-uniformity of the system to a great extent with only a small reduction in efﬁciency However, this remains a chal- lenge as mesa dimensions shrink to smaller areas of 5 l m and below.204 Recently, GE has developed a sub-micron sized red phos- phor K2SiF6:Mn4þ (KSF) and KSF inks suitable for microLEDs that can be deposited by low-cost methods such as ink-jet printing, slot die coating, or spin coating.233 These recent developments pave the way for phosphors to be further utilized in microLED applications by over- coming challenges due to their size 3 Compound semiconductor layers Electroluminescence, which is responsible for spontaneous light emission upon the passage of electric current, dates back to 1907 when Round discovered it in silicon carbide (SiC) crystals.234 Further under- standing of materials and luminescent phenomena makes tuning of bandgap an obvious choice for the creation of light emitting diodes of different colors.235–238 Red LEDs have traditionally used AlGaInP crystals, but recent focus has shifted to indium gallium nitride (InGaN) crystals as they offer a wide spectral range from ultraviolet to infrared.239 InGaN bandgap energy can be tuned from 0.67 to 3.42 eV by changing the composition of the alloy.129,240,241 Figure 17 shows the energy bandgap of hexagonal gallium nitride (h-GaN) as a func- tion of lattice constant that is controlled by the indium (In) concentra- tion in the alloy The external quantum efﬁciency (EQE) of the microLED decreases with decreasing device size due to the increased non- radiative recombination, also known as efﬁciency droop.100 While the peak EQE of a 20 \\x02 20 lm blue microLED has been reported to be as high as 33%, AlGaInP-based red microLEDs suffer signiﬁcantly from efﬁciency droop due to high surface recombination and long carrier lifetime at smaller dimensions (<50 lm).242–244 They also suffer from poor thermal stability at high temperatures.245,246 This has resulted in a growing interest in creating red microLEDs that are based on III- nitride materials, in particular InGaN.247,248 The EQE of red InGaN FIG 16 Phosphor structure and emission spectrum (a) The crystal structure of a nar-

is still notably low because increasing indium (In) content in the alloy degrades crystal quality due to a large lattice mismatch and low-temperature growth.249 Various fabrication techniques, such as strain engineering, lower growth rates, and high growth temperatures, are required to tackle the low EQE problem facing III-nitride based red microLEDs.250 A more detailed review of the development of red microLEDs can be found in the manuscript from Iida et al.250 Apart from applications in display technologies, the development of different colored efﬁcient microLEDs is important for other applica- tions such as optogenetics The activation or suppression of different cells expressed by different proteins is highly desirable for more precise control over the neuronal activity Red-and-blue-colored microLED-based optoelectronic probes have been used to demonstrate bi-directional neuronal activity manipulation.251,252 Dual-colored microLED arrays have also been used as VLC transmitters and dem- onstrated error-free data rates of 1.79–3.35 Gbps in a dual-wavelength multiplexing scheme.253 Further work is needed to enhance the efﬁ- ciency of longer wavelength microLEDs as longer wavelengths enable deeper neural cell stimulation in optogenetics and wavelength division multiplexing in VLC systems.254,255 V OUTLOOK AND CHALLENGES As discussed in the article, MicroLED/LED technology has been incorporated into a range of applications beyond display applications MicroLEDs based on InGaN/GaN have consistently higher efﬁciencies than competing approaches even as we scale down the device dimen- sions to sub-micron size for blue, green, and red emissions The efﬁ- ciency of the red-colored InGaN/GaN microLEDs can stand further improvement, especially at smaller dimensions The ability to achieve RGB emission from a single material stack will open a wide array of applications with increasingly complex system integration Additionally, the relatively high cost of GaN epi wafers remains a chal- lenge to be addressed, as microLED technology is adopted into a greater number of applications such as point-of-care medical applica- tions like phototherapy and skin treatments.256,257 The adoption of microLEDs in visible light communication (VLC) systems has rapidly grown with improved data transfer rates An increase in the modulation bandwidth is the driving factor for the higher data transfer rates Device miniaturization and the decrease in carrier lifetime of microLEDs can further improve this trend Additionally, VLC systems that use an array of microLEDs as emitters have the potential to enhance the data transfer rates even higher, albeit with the increased system complexity Implementation of VLC in lab- oratory setup is routinely demonstrated, but the real-life system still remains a challenge Many critical issues such as reliability, scalability, and compactness related to the commercialization of the VLC systems remain to be addressed As optogenetics advances our understanding of neural circuits, microLEDs will have an increasingly prevalent role in delivering spa- tially resolved single-neuron stimulation', 'OPTICAL STRUCTURES FOR IMPROVED PERFORMANCE Despite the superior performance of microLEDs when compared with OLEDs, modiﬁcation in the key properties of microLEDs is often required for non-display applications Electro-optical components such as photonic crystals, nanostructures, microlenses, Fresnel lenses, quantum dots, phosphors, etc., are integrated with the traditional microLEDs to improve the output performance Key optical compo- nents that can enhance the performance metrics of microLEDs and make them more suitable for use in non-display applications are dis- cussed in Secs IVA–V A Extraction efficiency enhancement The low extraction efﬁciency of microLEDs originates from the traditionally grown epilayer structure of the GaN LEDs.6,106,144 A typi- cal GaN epi structure is grown hetero-epitaxially on a sapphire sub- strate due to the lack of availability of a suitable substrate for homoepitaxial growth.145,146 The photons generated inside the GaN FIG 9 A graph showing the 3-dB modulation bandwidth of microLEDs as a func- tion of current density for different pixel sizes ranging from 60 to 160 lm The mod- ulation bandwidth initially increases as the current density of

of the extracted light.147 Researchers have suggested methods including chip shaping, photonic crystals, surface roughness, and mesa shape modiﬁcation to improve the extraction efﬁciency of microLEDs.148–152 This section discusses the techniques for extraction efﬁciency enhancement in the context of various non-display applications 1 Photonic crystals Photonic crystals (PhCs) are repeated dielectric structures of length scales similar to the wavelength of light.148,153,154 These crystals have the capability to modify spontaneous light emission by creating a photonic bandgap that can interact with the electronic bandgap of the emission material.155 The photonic bandgap can be utilized in two ways to increase the extraction efﬁciency: inhibiting the emission of the guided modes or redirecting trapped light into radiated modes The photonic crystals should be physically very close to the active light emitting region to maximize their impact Wierer et al demonstrated electrically operated InGaN/GaN LEDs with photonic crystals having a tunnel junction to provide lateral current spreading to the photonics crystals.154 This work reports increased microLED radiance and an approximately 1.5x total increase in light extraction with photonic crystals incorporation Additionally, the far-ﬁeld radiation pattern of LEDs with PhC was also radically different than planar LEDs.154 Oder et al demonstrated extraction efﬁciency enhancement of 63% in InGaN/GaN blue (460 nm) microLEDs and 95% in AlInGaN/ GaN UV (340 nm) microLEDs', 'further advanced the tech- nique by combining a CMOS-controlled microLED array with a projection system and translation stage to achieve written features as small as 8 lm.27 Building further on the same setup, Guilhabert et al reported mask-fee direct pattern writing with features as small as 500 nm by primarily modifying the projection optics.96 They also showed the fabrication of InGaN micro-LEDs using the same setup Recently, Wu

enabling performance properties Table I summarizes the reviewed non-display applications and the key desirable properties MicroLED technology offers superior performance than organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) for key properties such as brightness, response time, and lifetime Table II summarizes the performance comparison between the microLEDs and OLED technology.99 Many of the metrics, such as superior brightness, reliability, and lifetime, make microLEDs well-suited to both display and non-display, but some of the key performance metrics for non-display applications dif- fer from those for display applications This section discusses the key performance parameters of microLEDs that must be optimized or enhanced for non-display applications These metrics include optical extraction,

quantum efﬁciencies (IQEs) that can exceed ninety percent as a result of advances in growth techniques that have yielded high-quality materials and crystal structures.100–103 However, the external quantum efﬁciency (EQE) of GaN-based microLEDs, deﬁned as the ratio of the number of photons emitted vs the number of photons internally generated, is comparatively low with a peak EQE of generally smaller than 15%.104–106 The EQE of the microLEDs can be viewed as the product of two separate efﬁciencies: IQE and light extraction efﬁciency (LEE).107 While IQE is signiﬁcantly improved over the years, LEE has been a limiting factor.100,108,109 Low LEE is primarily due to the large refractive index difference between air and semiconductors that traps light from total internal reﬂection (TIR) and Fresnel loss at the interface.110 For example, the external efﬁciency could be as low as 4.3% in a typical semiconductor material with a refractive index of 2.4', 'reported a white light VLC system that used semi-polar blue microLEDs and yellow phosphors to achieve a data rate of 2.805 Gbps.128 The higher data rate and band- width of the system are attributed to the improved radiative efﬁciency of the semi-polar blue microLEDs resulting from the reduced quantum-conﬁned Stark effect (QCSE) A hybrid strategy of mixing small-sized and large-sized phos- phors can improve the non-uniformity of the system to a great extent with only a small reduction in efﬁciency However, this remains a chal- lenge as mesa dimensions shrink to smaller areas of 5 l m and below.204 Recently, GE has developed a sub-micron sized red phos- phor K2SiF6:Mn4þ (KSF) and KSF inks suitable for microLEDs that can be deposited by low-cost methods such as ink-jet printing, slot die coating, or spin coating.233 These recent developments pave the way for phosphors to be further utilized in microLED applications by over- coming challenges due to their size 3 Compound semiconductor layers Electroluminescence, which is responsible for spontaneous light emission upon the passage of electric current, dates back to 1907 when Round discovered it in silicon carbide (SiC) crystals.234 Further under- standing of materials and luminescent phenomena makes tuning of bandgap an obvious choice for the creation of light emitting diodes of different colors.235–238 Red LEDs have traditionally used AlGaInP crystals, but recent focus has shifted to indium gallium nitride (InGaN) crystals as they offer a wide spectral range from ultraviolet to infrared.239 InGaN bandgap energy can be tuned from 0.67 to 3.42 eV by changing the composition of the alloy.129,240,241 Figure 17 shows the energy bandgap of hexagonal gallium nitride (h-GaN) as a func- tion of lattice constant that is controlled by the indium (In) concentra- tion in the alloy The external quantum efﬁciency (EQE) of the microLED decreases with decreasing device size due to the increased non- radiative recombination, also known as efﬁciency droop.100 While the peak EQE of a 20 \\x02 20 lm blue microLED has been reported to be as high as 33%, AlGaInP-based red microLEDs suffer signiﬁcantly from efﬁciency droop due to high surface recombination and long carrier lifetime at smaller dimensions (<50 lm).242–244 They also suffer from poor thermal stability at high temperatures.245,246 This has resulted in a growing interest in creating red microLEDs that are based on III- nitride materials, in particular InGaN.247,248 The EQE of red InGaN FIG 16 Phosphor structure and emission spectrum (a) The crystal structure of a nar-

applications which use microLEDs as light sources, modiﬁcations in key electrical and optical char- acteristics such as external efﬁciency, output beam shape, modulation bandwidth, light output power,

visible light communication (VLC) systems has been investigated both as emitter devices and as photode- tectors (PD).19–21,34 The VLC system, shown in Fig 2(c), consists of three primary components: an optical transmitter, an optical channel, and a receiver.35 The optical transmitter contains the waveform gener- ator, encoders, driver electronics, microLED emitters, and transmitter optics The optical channel allows for data transfer through air or another desired medium The receiver contains receiver optics, photo- detectors, ampliﬁers, and decoders The schematic diagram of a mea- surement setup for frequency response characterization having similar components is also shown in Fig 2(a) The lower RC values of microLEDs arising from their small size (1–100 lm) and short carrier lifetime result in a high modulation bandwidth A higher 3-dB modulation bandwidth allows a higher data rate transfer in the communication system These characteristics make microLEDs an attractive choice for optical data emitters in high-speed FIG 2 The schematic diagram of a visible light communication (VLC) system (a) The system setup to measure the frequency response of microLEDs The system consists of a vector network analyzer, a bias-tee for operating the microLED, a plastic ﬁber for coupling the light, and a photodetector (b) A plot showing improved frequency response with increasing injected current density The current is increased from 5 to 40 mA A maximum 3-dB modulation bandwidth of 756 MHz is shown in the inset at 2000 A/cm2 (c) The system setup for VLC communication data-rate characterization consists of the signal quality analyzer, 20 dB ampliﬁer, bias-tee, photodetector, and a digital oscilloscope', 'This changes the lattice constant of InGaN crystal from approximately

is still notably low because increasing indium (In) content in the alloy degrades crystal quality due to a large lattice mismatch and low-temperature growth.249 Various fabrication techniques, such as strain engineering, lower growth rates, and high growth temperatures, are required to tackle the low EQE problem facing III-nitride based red microLEDs.250 A more detailed review of the development of red microLEDs can be found in the manuscript from Iida et al.250 Apart from applications in display technologies, the development of different colored efﬁcient microLEDs is important for other applica- tions such as optogenetics The activation or suppression of different cells expressed by different proteins is highly desirable for more precise control over the neuronal activity Red-and-blue-colored microLED-based optoelectronic probes have been used to demonstrate bi-directional neuronal activity manipulation.251,252 Dual-colored microLED arrays have also been used as VLC transmitters and dem- onstrated error-free data rates of 1.79–3.35 Gbps in a dual-wavelength multiplexing scheme.253 Further work is needed to enhance the efﬁ- ciency of longer wavelength microLEDs as longer wavelengths enable deeper neural cell stimulation in optogenetics and wavelength division multiplexing in VLC systems.254,255 V OUTLOOK AND CHALLENGES As discussed in the article, MicroLED/LED technology has been incorporated into a range of applications beyond display applications MicroLEDs based on InGaN/GaN have consistently higher efﬁciencies than competing approaches even as we scale down the device dimen- sions to sub-micron size for blue, green, and red emissions The efﬁ- ciency of the red-colored InGaN/GaN microLEDs can stand further improvement, especially at smaller dimensions The ability to achieve RGB emission from a single material stack will open a wide array of applications with increasingly complex system integration Additionally, the relatively high cost of GaN epi wafers remains a chal- lenge to be addressed, as microLED technology is adopted into a greater number of applications such as point-of-care medical applica- tions like phototherapy and skin treatments.256,257 The adoption of microLEDs in visible light communication (VLC) systems has rapidly grown with improved data transfer rates An increase in the modulation bandwidth is the driving factor for the higher data transfer rates Device miniaturization and the decrease in carrier lifetime of microLEDs can further improve this trend Additionally, VLC systems that use an array of microLEDs as emitters have the potential to enhance the data transfer rates even higher, albeit with the increased system complexity Implementation of VLC in lab- oratory setup is routinely demonstrated, but the real-life system still remains a challenge Many critical issues such as reliability, scalability, and compactness related to the commercialization of the VLC systems remain to be addressed As optogenetics advances our understanding of neural circuits, microLEDs will have an increasingly prevalent role in delivering spa- tially resolved single-neuron stimulation', 'OPTICAL STRUCTURES FOR IMPROVED PERFORMANCE Despite the superior performance of microLEDs when compared with OLEDs, modiﬁcation in the key properties of microLEDs is often required for non-display applications Electro-optical components such as photonic crystals, nanostructures, microlenses, Fresnel lenses, quantum dots, phosphors, etc., are integrated with the traditional microLEDs to improve the output performance Key optical compo- nents that can enhance the performance metrics of microLEDs and make them more suitable for use in non-display applications are dis- cussed in Secs IVA–V A Extraction efficiency enhancement The low extraction efﬁciency of microLEDs originates from the traditionally grown epilayer structure of the GaN LEDs.6,106,144 A typi- cal GaN epi structure is grown hetero-epitaxially on a sapphire sub- strate due to the lack of availability of a suitable substrate for homoepitaxial growth.145,146 The photons generated inside the GaN FIG 9 A graph showing the 3-dB modulation bandwidth of microLEDs as a func- tion of current density for different pixel sizes ranging from 60 to 160 lm The mod- ulation bandwidth initially increases as the current density of microLED increases and then saturates for higher current density operation The smaller pixel sizes achieve higher modulation bandwidth as they can be operated at higher current density The markers on the plot denote the maximal modulation bandwidth in the measurement for each size Reproduced with permission from Huang et al., Phys Status Solidi A 215, 1800484 (2018).122 Copyright 2018 WILEY-VCH

of the extracted light.147 Researchers have suggested methods including chip shaping, photonic crystals, surface roughness, and mesa shape modiﬁcation to improve the extraction efﬁciency of microLEDs.148–152 This section discusses the techniques for extraction efﬁciency enhancement in the context of various non-display applications 1 Photonic crystals Photonic crystals (PhCs) are repeated dielectric structures of length scales similar to the wavelength of light.148,153,154 These crystals have the capability to modify spontaneous light emission by creating a photonic bandgap that can interact with the electronic bandgap of the emission material.155 The photonic bandgap can be utilized in two ways to increase the extraction efﬁciency: inhibiting the emission of the guided modes or redirecting trapped light into radiated modes The photonic crystals should be physically very close to the active light emitting region to maximize their impact Wierer et al demonstrated electrically operated InGaN/GaN LEDs with photonic crystals having a tunnel junction to provide lateral current spreading to the photonics crystals.154 This work reports increased microLED radiance and an approximately 1.5x total increase in light extraction with photonic crystals incorporation Additionally, the far-ﬁeld radiation pattern of LEDs with PhC was also radically different than planar LEDs.154 Oder et al demonstrated extraction efﬁciency enhancement of 63% in InGaN/GaN blue (460 nm) microLEDs and 95% in AlInGaN/ GaN UV (340 nm) microLEDs', 'further advanced the tech- nique by combining a CMOS-controlled microLED array with a projection system and translation stage to achieve written features as small as 8 lm.27 Building further on the same setup, Guilhabert et al reported mask-fee direct pattern writing with features as small as 500 nm by primarily modifying the projection optics.96 They also showed the fabrication of InGaN micro-LEDs using the same setup Recently, Wu et al reported a UV micro-LED display with full high- deﬁnition of 960 \\x02 540 and 1920 \\x02 1080 for pattern-programmable maskless photolithography on resist-coated wafers.98 Figure 6(b) shows the microLED display and a patterned Si substrate using mask- less lithography All these reports show the potential of microLED technology for photolithography applications that require minimal setup and provide a budget-friendly alternative to traditional laser- based systems III PERFORMANCE METRICS FOR NON-DISPLAY APPLICATIONS The various applications discussed in Sec II have different pri- mary enabling performance properties Table I summarizes the reviewed non-display applications and the key desirable properties MicroLED technology offers superior performance than organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) for key properties such as brightness, response time, and lifetime Table II summarizes the performance comparison between the microLEDs and OLED technology.99 Many of the metrics, such as superior brightness, reliability, and lifetime, make microLEDs well-suited to both display and non-display, but some of the key performance metrics for non-display applications dif- fer from those for display applications This section discusses the key performance parameters of microLEDs that must be optimized or enhanced for non-display applications These metrics include optical extraction, angle of extraction, modulation bandwidth, light output power, and response time FIG 6 (a) A micro-projection system used for maskless UV photolithography The system consists of CMOS driven microLED

quantum efﬁciencies (IQEs) that can exceed ninety percent as a result of advances in growth techniques that have yielded high-quality materials and crystal structures.100–103 However, the external quantum efﬁciency (EQE) of GaN-based microLEDs, deﬁned as the ratio of the number of photons emitted vs the number of photons internally generated, is comparatively low with a peak EQE of generally smaller than 15%.104–106 The EQE of the microLEDs can be viewed as the product of two separate efﬁciencies: IQE and light extraction efﬁciency (LEE).107 While IQE is signiﬁcantly improved over the years, LEE has been a limiting factor.100,108,109 Low LEE is primarily due to the large refractive index difference between air and semiconductors that traps light from total internal reﬂection (TIR) and Fresnel loss at the interface.110 For example, the external efﬁciency could be as low as 4.3% in a typical semiconductor material with a refractive index of 2.4', 'reported a white light VLC system that used semi-polar blue microLEDs and yellow phosphors to achieve a data rate of 2.805 Gbps.128 The higher data rate and band- width of the system are attributed to the improved radiative efﬁciency of the semi-polar blue microLEDs resulting from the reduced quantum-conﬁned Stark effect (QCSE) A hybrid strategy of mixing small-sized and large-sized phos- phors can improve the non-uniformity of the system to a great extent with only a small reduction in efﬁciency However, this remains a chal- lenge as mesa dimensions shrink to smaller areas of 5 l m and below.204 Recently, GE has developed a sub-micron sized red phos- phor K2SiF6:Mn4þ (KSF) and KSF inks suitable for microLEDs that can be deposited by low-cost methods such as ink-jet printing, slot die coating, or spin coating.233 These recent developments pave the way for phosphors to be further utilized in microLED applications by over- coming challenges due to their size 3 Compound semiconductor layers Electroluminescence, which is responsible for spontaneous light emission upon the passage of electric current, dates back to 1907 when Round discovered it in silicon carbide (SiC) crystals.234 Further under- standing of materials and luminescent phenomena makes tuning of bandgap an obvious choice for the creation of light emitting diodes of different colors.235–238 Red LEDs have traditionally used AlGaInP crystals, but recent focus has shifted to indium gallium nitride (InGaN) crystals as they offer a wide spectral range from ultraviolet to infrared.239 InGaN bandgap energy can be tuned from 0.67 to 3.42 eV by changing the composition of the alloy.129,240,241 Figure 17 shows the energy bandgap of hexagonal gallium nitride (h-GaN) as a func- tion of lattice constant that is controlled by the indium (In) concentra- tion in the alloy The external quantum efﬁciency (EQE) of the microLED decreases with decreasing device size due to the increased non- radiative recombination, also known as efﬁciency droop.100 While the peak EQE of a 20 \\x02 20 lm blue microLED has been reported to be as high as 33%, AlGaInP-based red microLEDs suffer signiﬁcantly from efﬁciency droop due to high surface recombination and long carrier lifetime at smaller dimensions (<50 lm).242–244 They also suffer from poor thermal stability at high temperatures.245,246 This has resulted in a growing interest in creating red microLEDs that are based on III- nitride materials, in particular InGaN.247,248 The EQE of red InGaN FIG 16 Phosphor structure and emission spectrum (a) The crystal structure of a nar-
