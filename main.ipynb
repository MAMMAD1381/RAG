But I warn you, if you don’t tell me that this means war, if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that Antichrist—I really believe he is Antichrist—I will have nothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my ‘faithful slave’, as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see I have frightened you—sit down and tell me all the news.\"\n","\n","It was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna Pavlovna Scherer, maid of honour and favourite of the Empress Marya Fedorovna. With these words she greeted Prince Vasili Kuragin, a man of high rank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna Pavlovna had had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering from la grippe; grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used only by the elite.\n","\n","All her invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered by a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:\n","\n","\"If you have nothing better to do, Count [or Prince], and if the prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible, I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10—Annette Scherer.\"\n","\n","\"Heavens! what a virulent attack!\" replied the prince, not in the least disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing an embroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke in that refined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, and with the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance who had grown old in society and at court. He went up to Anna Pavlovna, kissed her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head, and complacently seated himself on the sofa.\n","\n","\"First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend’s mind at rest,\" said he without altering his tone, beneath the politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be discerned.\n","\n","\"Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times like these if one has any feeling?\" said Anna Pavlovna. \"You are staying the whole evening, I hope?\"\n","\n","\"And the fete at the English ambassador’s? Today is Wednesday. I must put in an appearance there,\" said the prince. \"My daughter is coming for me to take me there.\"\n","\n","\"I thought today’s fete had been cancelled. I confess all these festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.\"\n","\n","\"If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have been put off,\" said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by force of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed.\n","\n","\"Don’t tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novosiltsev’s dispatch? You know everything.\"\n","\n","\"What can one say about it?\" replied the prince in a cold, listless tone. \"What has been decided? They have decided that Buonaparte has burnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn ours.\"\n","\n","Prince Vasili always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a stale part. Anna Pavlovna Scherer on the contrary, despite her forty years, overflowed with animation and impulsiveness. To be an enthusiast had become her social vocation and, sometimes even when she did not feel like it, she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the expectations of those who knew her. The subdued smile which, though it did not suit her faded features, always played round her lips expressed, as in a spoiled child, a continual consciousness of her charming defect, which she neither wished, nor could, nor considered it necessary, to correct.\n","\n","In the midst of a conversation on political matters Anna Pavlovna burst out:\n","\n","\"The Empress is pregnant again. Bonaparte will leave all Europe without monarchs. He evidently has conceived that the French are to be an exclusive people. Perhaps he has met his former wife and repented of his sins. To-day no one would be surprised at any change in his plans.\"\n","\n","\"Bonaparte seems to have forgotten that there are laws of political economy. Princes should always remember this. Here is a curious fact. When I was in London there were two women of rank, both of whom I knew personally, who gave birth to sons at precisely the same time. One was at the age of forty, the other at thirty. The first son was delicate, small, and weak; the second was a veritable Hercules. It was all the difference of ten years. Now if you please, the same thing holds true of Europe. Bonaparte forgets that the sovereigns who rule Europe are men like other men. And I dare say if you examined the matter, you would find that the nations that are ruled by these sovereigns are just as susceptible to diseases, to shocks, to all the influences that weaken and ruin men. And I am convinced that Bonaparte, the genius, the man who is so great a personage in his own estimation, is merely an instrument of Providence who is now wreaking vengeance upon the sovereigns of Europe.

But I warn you, if you don’t tell me that this means war, if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that Antichrist—I really believe he is Antichrist—I will have nothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my ‘faithful slave’, as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see I have frightened you—sit down and tell me all the news.\"\n","\n","It was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna Pavlovna Scherer, maid of honour and favourite of the Empress Marya Fedorovna. With these words she greeted Prince Vasili Kuragin, a man of high rank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna Pavlovna had had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering from la grippe; grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used only by the elite.\n","\n","All her invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered by a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:\n","\n","\"If you have nothing better to do, Count [or Prince], and if the prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible, I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10—Annette Scherer.\"\n","\n","\"Heavens! what a virulent attack!\" replied the prince, not in the least disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing an embroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke in that refined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, and with the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance who had grown old in society and at court. He went up to Anna Pavlovna, kissed her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head, and complacently seated himself on the sofa.\n","\n","\"First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend’s mind at rest,\" said he without altering his tone, beneath the politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be discerned.\n","\n","\"Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times like these if one has any feeling?\" said Anna Pavlovna. \"You are staying the whole evening, I hope?\"\n","\n","\"And the fete at the English ambassador’s? Today is Wednesday. I must put in an appearance there,\" said the prince. \"My daughter is coming for me to take me there.\"\n","\n","\"I thought today’s fete had been cancelled. I confess all these festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.\"\n","\n","\"If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have been put off,\" said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by force of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed.\n","\n","\"Don’t tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novosiltsev’s dispatch? You know everything.\"\n","\n","\"What can one say about it?\" replied the prince in a cold, listless tone. \"What has been decided? They have decided that Buonaparte has burnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn ours.\"\n","\n","Prince Vasili always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a stale part. Anna Pavlovna Scherer on the contrary, despite her forty years, overflowed with animation and impulsiveness. To be an enthusiast had become her social vocation and, sometimes even when she did not feel like it, she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the expectations of those who knew her. The subdued smile which, though it did not suit her faded features, always played round her lips expressed, as in a spoiled child, a continual consciousness of her charming defect, which she neither wished, nor could, nor considered it necessary, to correct.\n","\n","In the midst of a conversation on political matters Anna Pavlovna burst out:\n","\n","\"The Empress is pregnant again. Bonaparte will leave all Europe without monarchs. He evidently has conceived that the French are to be an exclusive people. Perhaps he has met his former wife and repented of his sins. To-day no one would be surprised at any change in his plans.\"\n","\n","\"Bonaparte seems to have forgotten that there are laws of political economy. Princes should always remember this. Here is a curious fact. When I was in London there were two women of rank, both of whom I knew personally, who gave birth to sons at precisely the same time. One was at the age of forty, the other at thirty. The first son was delicate, small, and weak; the second was a veritable Hercules. It was all the difference of ten years. Now if you please, the same thing holds true of Europe. Bonaparte forgets that the sovereigns who rule Europe are men like other men. And I dare say if you examined the matter, you would find that the nations that are ruled by these sovereigns are just as susceptible to diseases, to shocks, to all the influences that weaken and ruin men. And I am convinced that Bonaparte, the genius, the man who is so great a personage in his own estimation, is merely an instrument of Providence who is now wreaking vengeance upon the sovereigns of Europe. I can assure you he is no more than that.\"\n","\n","Anna Pavlovna paused in her tirade and looked at Prince Vasili with a questioning smile.\n","\n","\"Well, what do you think?\" she asked, seeing that he had not stirred a muscle. \"Is there anything in what I say?\"\"\"\n","\n","summarizer = T5_Summarizer(load_online=True)\n","summary = summarizer.summarize_text(context)\n","print(summary)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"mx1GETenIlr_","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1717801014948,"user_tz":-210,"elapsed":101112,"user":{"displayName":"mohammad mohammdian","userId":"16778632015796518458"}},"outputId":"8a6d92e4-0547-4419-98d4-fbf7a18af536"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["Special tokens have been added in the vocabulary, make sure the associated word embeddings are fine-tuned or trained.\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":[": \"The Empress is pregnant again.

These characteristics are highly desirable in various applications, but their usage has, to date, been primarily focused toward next-generation display technologies. Applications of microLEDs in other technologies, such as projector systems, computational imaging, communication systems, or neural stim- ulation, have been limited. In non-display applications which use microLEDs as light sources, modiﬁcations in key electrical and optical char- acteristics such as external efﬁciency, output beam shape, modulation bandwidth, light output power, and emission wavelengths are often needed for optimum performance. A number of', 'advanced fabrication and processing techniques have been used to achieve these electro- optical characteristics in microLEDs. In this article, we review the non-display application areas of the microLEDs, the distinct opto- electrical characteristics required for these applications, and techniques that integrate the optical and electrical components on the microLEDs to improve system-level efﬁcacy and performance.

These devices are an integral part of the solid-state lighting ecosystem including automobiles, smartphones, home lighting systems, and industrial lighting.1–5 The adoption of LEDs has enabled additional functionalities in the form of longer life- time, more reliable operation, smaller form factor, and lower power consumption in almost every application. Much of', 'the effort toward cost reduction in LEDs has been focused on increasing external efﬁciency using improved material growth techniques and optimizing fabrication processes.6 The reduc- tion in high costs of GaN semiconductor-based light emitting diodes is a challenge that needs to be addressed. Recent progress toward Appl. Phys.

A number of these char- acteristics are especially highly desirable in displays for augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications. There are multiple next-generation display demonstrations in the commercial sector. Samsung demonstrated a microLED display of 292 inches at CES 2020.12 Jade Bird has demonstrated a microdisplay of 0.3 in. with 5000 PPI for AR/VR applications.13 Recently, Compound Photonics unveiled a microdisplay with a', 'record resolution of 8424 PPI.14 The wide interest from the commercial sector to push for the next genera- tion of display technologies using microLEDs has propelled the research effort into improving the key microLED characteristics such as efﬁciency, brightness, full-color emission, and lifetime. While microLEDs have been receiving signiﬁcant commercial interest for their use as emitters for display technology, little commer- cial focus has been applied to microLEDs for non-display applications, which is an active area of research (see Fig. 1). While high information content displays require a high resolution and small pixels, which can lead to challenges including reduced', 'efﬁciency due to greater non- radiative recombination, higher current density, and degraded extrac- tion,15–18 many of the reviewed non-display applications can beneﬁt from single pixel control and take advantage of relatively efﬁcient, larger pixels. Future applications, especially in areas that beneﬁt from ultra-small (e.g., sub micrometer) LEDs, experience some of these challenges and are brieﬂy also discussed. MicroLEDs are increasingly being used as a signal emitter in visible light communication (VLC) systems due to their high modulation bandwidth and ability to offer parallel channels for communication using microLED array.19–21 MicroLEDs are also well-suited for optogenetic stimulation, requiring a spatially resolved', 'high-intensity light source.22–24 Multiple computa- tional microscopy techniques, such as structured illumination micros- copy (SIM), for neural imaging have also used microLEDs as light sources.25,26 The high intensity emission in the UV-blue spectrum also makes microLEDs suitable for maskless lithography.27 These non- display applications often require modiﬁcation in the electro-optical characteristics of microLEDs. Performance characteristics such as modulation bandwidth, light output power, emission wavelength, and extraction efﬁciency are tailored by integrating additional optical and electrical structures (see Fig. 1). The fabrication of the optical struc- tures requires more processing on the top of the microLED structure. Despite the progress in', 'fabrication capabilities, a number of challenges remain to be addressed for these applications. In this review, we explore microLED electro-optical characteris- tics needed for non-display applications. We ﬁrst discuss multiple non-display application areas highlighting key past results and ongo- ing research work. We then examine the performance metrics critical for the non-display applications. Deﬁnitions of the key metrics from a non-display application point of view are presented. We also highlight optical structures such as photonic crystals, microlens, quantum dots, FIG. 1. A schematic diagram illustrating the correlation of key non-display applications (structured illumination microscopy, optogenetic stimulation, multi-contrast imaging, visi- ble', 'light communication, maskless lithography, solid-state lighting) and relevant properties of microLED/LED (external quantum efﬁciency, angle of extraction, modulation band- width, light output power, emission wavelength). It also highlights the electro-optical structures and techniques, such as patterned sapphire substrates, photonic crystals, microlenses, quantum dots, etc., required to modify the key properties.

Finally, the outlook and challenges associated with the integration', 'of advanced structures with microLEDs and their broader applications are discussed. The schematic diagram encom- passing the review is shown in Fig. 1. II. NON-DISPLAY APPLICATION AREAS MicroLEDs have been extensively explored as pixels for next- generation displays with ultra-high brightness, deeper color gamut, and longer lifetime.28–31 The high luminance, energy efﬁciency, reli- ability, low cost, and bio-compatibility of microLEDs also enable them to be used in various non-display technologies such as visible light communications (VLC), photolithography, optogenetics stimulation, light sources for structured illumination microscopy (SIM), and super- resolution imaging.22,25–27,32,33 This section focuses on the system setup and recent progress', 'of each of these applications. A. Visible Light Communication (VLC) The usage of microLEDs in visible light communication (VLC) systems has been investigated both as emitter devices and as photode- tectors (PD).19–21,34 The VLC system, shown in Fig. 2(c), consists of three primary components: an optical transmitter, an optical channel, and a receiver.35 The optical transmitter contains the waveform gener- ator, encoders, driver electronics, microLED emitters, and transmitter optics. The optical channel allows for data transfer through air or another desired medium. The receiver contains receiver optics, photo- detectors, ampliﬁers, and decoders. The schematic diagram of a mea- surement setup', 'for frequency response characterization having similar components is also shown in Fig. 2(a). The lower RC values of microLEDs arising from their small size (1–100 lm) and short carrier lifetime result in a high modulation bandwidth. A higher 3-dB modulation bandwidth allows a higher data rate transfer in the communication system. These characteristics make microLEDs an attractive choice for optical data emitters in high-speed FIG. 2. The schematic diagram of a visible light communication (VLC) system.

The system consists of a vector network analyzer, a bias-tee for operating the', 'microLED, a plastic ﬁber for coupling the light, and a photodetector.

A maximum 3-dB modulation bandwidth of 756 MHz is shown in the inset at 2000 A/cm2.

Additionally, 3-dB bandwidth is proportional to the increasing current density', 'as seen in the inset of Fig. 2(b). Data rates for VLC systems have increased from 1 Gbps to as high as 11.7 Gbps in recent works. Mckendry et al. demonstrated a data transfer speed of 1 Gbps in 2010 using an individually addressable 16 \\x02 16 microLED array with 72 l m diameter pixel size.19 The blue emitter of wavelength 450 nm showed a 3-dB modulation bandwidth of 245 MHz. In 2020, Xie et al. demonstrated a record data transfer rate of 11.7 Gbps using a series-biased blue 3 \\x02 3 microLED array.38 This array featured smaller 20 lm', 'diameter elements, generated over 10 mW of optical power, and displayed a high 3-dB modulation band- width of 980 MHz. Many modulation schemes can be used to encode the data in the VLC systems. Most microLED VLC systems report implementing one of three key modulation schemes: Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM), On-Off Key (OOK), or Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). The selection of one method depends on the prioritization of complexity or efﬁciency requirements. A detailed dis- cussion of modulation schemes in VLC systems can be found in the comprehensive text by Nan Chi (2018).39 The use of pixels with increasingly', 'small diameters (tens of micrometers) to achieve improved data transfer rates of more than 10 Gbps in VLC systems is an encouraging sign that next-generation communication systems could be successfully implemented using microLED technology. B. Optogenetic stimulation Optogenetics, the technique by which light is used to selectively stimulate neural cells, has revolutionized the ﬁeld of neuroscience.40–47 It is a most widely used method to study the causal relationship between neural circuits and behavior.46 Researchers have explored using various light transmission methods, including ﬁber optic cables and waveguides, to deliver stimuli to speciﬁc neuron cell popula- tions.48–51 These approaches can stimulate', 'a large number of neural cells, but struggle to deliver light at a high spatial resolution, a key requirement for decoding neural circuits. Grossman et al. proposed a simple solution to this problem by creating an array of microLEDs capable of generating arbitrary optical excitation patterns on neuronal samples with high resolution.52 This concept of matrix photostimula- tion is illustrated in Fig. 3(a). A light-sensitive ion channel known as channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) provides a powerful tool for millisecond neural excitation.40 ChR2 expressing neural cells are covered with microLEDs that each has individual control over their illumination intensity and timing for optical', 'excitation. To gain a fuller understanding of the causal relationship between neuronal circuits and their behavior, simultaneous localized stimula- tion and electrical recording of neural cells are required. Such an experimental setup then must address the additional challenge of directly integrating light sources onto the stimulation sites. Scalable designs that monolithically integrate microLEDs and recording sites onto silicon neural probes can solve this problem to enable closed- loop light stimulation and electrical recordings.53–55 Figure 3(b) shows the 48 microLED probe used by Wu et al. to independently stimulate distinct cells spaced 50 l m apart.53 Neural recordings from a freely', 'moving mouse using this probe are also shown. Scharf et al. used a similar approach but increased their system’s scalability by integrating FIG. 3.

McAlinden et al. further scaled the optrode array by creating a device with the capability to deliver light stimuli at 181 sites. This milestone was achieved by a novel fabrication method for microLEDs on GaN-on-Sapphire with glass microneedle.56 Tethered neural stimulation restricts the free movement of rodents. To enable untethered, remote-controlled neural stimulation and electrochemical sensing of freely moving mice, Liu et al. developed wireless, implantable probes with microLEDs for optogenetic stimula- tion and dopamine detection.57 While these devices provide a high pre- cision spatiotemporal stimulation method, they can cause undesirable stimulation', 'artifacts with high enough amplitudes to mask neuronal activities.53 Kim et al. demonstrated opto-electrodes capable of eliminat- ing electromagnetic interference (EMI) induced and photovoltaic (PV) related stimulation artifacts using multi-layer metal structures and heavily boron-doped silicon substrates, respectively.58 The application of microLEDs in optogenetic stimulation is paving the way for studies of freely moving rodents’ neuronal circuits by providing compact optro- des that are essential for decoding the neural basis of behavior. C. Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM) Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) allows optical section- ing imaging (OS-SIM) and/or super-resolution imaging (SR-SIM) of neural cells by modifying conventional microscopes.59–63 It has', 'become a widely utilized method. Its widespread use can be attributed to its relatively simple setup, which enables wideﬁeld imaging and inte- gration with traditional microscopes. Structured illumination micros- copy (SIM) uses the principle that higher spatial frequencies attenuate faster with defocus than lower spatial frequencies. For an illuminated sample with a grid projection, the modulation in the out-of-focus part of the image attenuates faster than the thin in-focus part of the image. The optically sectioned part of the image can be extracted by looking at the modulation part in the image. Figure 4(a) demonstrates how the optically sectioned part', 'of the image can be extracted from the modu- lated image section. The grid moves into three equally spaced posi- tions, sequentially capturing thirds of the image and then combining them to obtain an optically sectioned or a super-resolved image.25 Traditionally, this has been achieved by placing a grating grid in the illumination path and then using a piezo-based system to mechan- ically move the pattern and obtain phase-shifting.64,65 The mechanical movement limits the speed and accuracy of the system. Digital micro- mirror device (DMD) based programmable spatial light modulators (SLMs) have been used to replace the gratings and get', 'around the aforementioned limitations caused by slow mechanical move- ment.26,66–68 These systems use lamp or LED based illumination. However, controlling illumination patterns using DMD increases the complexity of the system due to the added optical elements and increased optical path. They also suffer from the blazed grating effect that causes SIM patterns with varying intensity distribution.69,70 The resulting SIM patterns are prone to reconstruction artifacts. Using electrically programmable microLED arrays for patterned illumination is an efﬁcient, low-cost solution with no moving parts in a system. MicroLED based structural illumination also provides additional bin- ning capabilities for the illumination pattern. Figure', '4(b) shows a microscope setup developed by Poher et al. for optical sectioning using a microLED strip array as a light source.25 The ability to use the same microscope for the implementation of multiple imaging methods demonstrate a clear advantage of optical designs that use microLED array as a pattern illumination source. In addition, microLED-based light source systems could be miniaturized sufﬁciently to be used in miniscope designs for the neural imaging of freely moving mice which is essential for understanding the brain circuitry. A more detailed review of the SIM technique can be found in the cited articles.71–73 D.', 'Other imaging techniques Light emitting diode (LED) arrays have been used as a light source in a new type of microscope called an LED array microscope to FIG. 4.

This method of computational imaging allows label-free multi-contrast, i.e., bright- ﬁeld, darkﬁeld, phase contrast, and Fourier ptychography imaging to be combined on a single platform. Brightﬁeld contrast imaging is used to image samples with strong absorption, darkﬁeld contrast is better suited for sub-resolution features, and phase contrast is primarily uti- lized for a transparent sample.78 As different', 'contrast modes provide different information about a sample, it is desirable to have all the imaging modes on a single hardware platform. In traditional microscopy methods, different imaging techniques require hardware changes in the microscopy setup, while LED array microscopy provides a way to obtain different imaging modalities using a post-processing imaging algorithm without any change in the hardware. Figure 5(a) shows a time-multiplexing scheme implemented using LED arrays to obtain multi-contrast imaging. Even though these methods only require the modiﬁcation of conventional microscopes to achieve different imaging techniques, optical components such as lenses and objectives make it bulky and', 'expensive. For this reason, lens-free microscopy systems utilizing LEDs as light sources have become widely popular alternatives.80–84 This system consists of a known and a partially coherent light source for sample illumination and an image sensor for collecting the shadow image, which is then used to reconstruct the full image. Removing the objective lens from the optical path provides a way to decouple the ﬁeld of view (FOV) and resolution. In decoupled lens-free systems, the resolution is lim- ited by the pixel size, and the FOV is determined by the active area of the image sensor. The current resolution is', 'limited to around 1 lm.85 This limitation can be mitigated by using techniques such as pixel super-resolution at the expense of a more complex setup.82 The spatial resolution of the traditional optical systems is limited due to the laws of diffraction inherent to all optical systems.86,87 This limit is about 200 nm due to Abbe diffraction.88,89 Various super- resolution (SR) techniques, such as photoactivated localization micros- copy (PALM), stimulated emission depletion microscopy (STED), and stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), have been explored to mitigate this fundamental limit.74 Another approach to pushing past this limit using LEDs is emerg- ing as', 'the size of the microLEDs decreases toward nanoLEDs.90–92 The sub-micron dimensions of nanoLEDs allow them to serve as spatially resolved light sources and pave the way for Nano Illumination Microscopy (NIM).93,94 In this technique, spatially resolved light sour- ces are used to scan a sample by sequentially illuminating the nanoLED array and recording the optical signal through the sample on highly sensitive image sensors. Figure 5(b) shows how a sample can be imaged by measuring the intensity of light reaching an array of image sensors from each individual light source after passing through the sample. In this case, the resolution', 'of the system is limited by the pitch of the illu- mination source rather than the detection system. NanoLED arrays with pitches as small as 70nm have been demonstrated which can lead to a resolution of approximately 140nm which is much improved than the lens-free approach with resolution limited to around 1l m.85,92 With the absence of bulky lens systems, nanoLED methods could dra- matically improve the form factor of super-resolution microscopy and enable a new array of applications in biological imaging. E. Maskless photolithography Matrix addressable microLED and LED array emitters are highly desirable as light sources for photolithography', 'due to their ability to generate and transfer patterns on photosensitive materials without the FIG. 5.

As a result, it offers more ﬂexibility in the photolithography process and a', 'compact system. Several research groups have demonstrated the capability of microLEDs for maskless lithography.27,33,95,96 Jeon et al. performed mask-free photolithography using a 64 \\x02 64 UV microLED emitter array integrated with microlenses for light collimation.33 Two circular disks with 30 and 16 lm diameters were patterned using an i-line pho- toresist to demonstrate the proof of concept of the integrated device. Guijt et al. built a simpler and cost-effective photolithographic setup with off-the-shelf UV LEDs, hardware, and optical components.97 The system collimated light with a pinhole and plastic tube, focused on the sample with standard a microscope objective, and moved', 'the substrate into position with a motorized linear stage. The results demonstrated direct writing lithography for rapid prototyping of features smaller than 20 lm.97 A similar approach utilizing off-the-shelf UV LEDs and a rotary stage was used by Suzuki et al. for lithography of curved microstruc- tures.95 This work used the inherent Lambertian distribution property of the planar LED to achieve the difference in UV exposure dose required for high-aspect-ratio and curved surface structures such as microlenses and waveguides of hundreds of micrometers of thickness.95 Figure 6(a) shows how Elfstrom et al. further advanced the tech- nique by combining a', 'CMOS-controlled microLED array with a projection system and translation stage to achieve written features as small as 8 lm.27 Building further on the same setup, Guilhabert et al. reported mask-fee direct pattern writing with features as small as 500 nm by primarily modifying the projection optics.96 They also showed the fabrication of InGaN micro-LEDs using the same setup. Recently, Wu et al. reported a UV micro-LED display with full high- deﬁnition of 960 \\x02 540 and 1920 \\x02 1080 for pattern-programmable maskless photolithography on resist-coated wafers.98 Figure 6(b) shows the microLED display and a patterned Si substrate using mask- less', 'lithography. All these reports show the potential of microLED technology for photolithography applications that require minimal setup and provide a budget-friendly alternative to traditional laser- based systems. III. PERFORMANCE METRICS FOR NON-DISPLAY APPLICATIONS The various applications discussed in Sec. II have different pri- mary enabling performance properties. Table I summarizes the reviewed non-display applications and the key desirable properties. MicroLED technology offers superior performance than organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) for key properties such as brightness, response time, and lifetime. Table II summarizes the performance comparison between the microLEDs and OLED technology.99 Many of the metrics, such as superior brightness,', 'reliability, and lifetime, make microLEDs well-suited to both display and non-display, but some of the key performance metrics for non-display applications dif- fer from those for display applications. This section discusses the key performance parameters of microLEDs that must be optimized or enhanced for non-display applications. These metrics include optical extraction, angle of extraction, modulation bandwidth, light output power, and response time. FIG. 6.

Optical extraction efficiency—EQE vs IQE Blue microLEDs have internal quantum', 'efﬁciencies (IQEs) that can exceed ninety percent as a result of advances in growth techniques that have yielded high-quality materials and crystal structures.100–103 However, the external quantum efﬁciency (EQE) of GaN-based microLEDs, deﬁned as the ratio of the number of photons emitted vs the number of photons internally generated, is comparatively low with a peak EQE of generally smaller than 15%.104–106 The EQE of the microLEDs can be viewed as the product of two separate efﬁciencies: IQE and light extraction efﬁciency (LEE).107 While IQE is signiﬁcantly improved over the years, LEE has been a limiting factor.100,108,109 Low LEE is primarily', 'due to the large refractive index difference between air and semiconductors that traps light from total internal reﬂection (TIR) and Fresnel loss at the interface.110 For example, the external efﬁciency could be as low as 4.3% in a typical semiconductor material with a refractive index of 2.4. Figure 7 graphically demonstrates how only the light inside the escape cone, deﬁned by the critical angle, is able to escape. This limitation presents a challenge for microLEDs in applications such as optogenetic stimulation because the photosensi- tive opsins often require minimum irradiance (typically in the range of 10–100 mW/cm2 in instantaneous light', 'intensity) to be delivered at the neurons for activation and ﬂuorescence.111,112 Achieving the desired optical power numbers with smaller microLEDs requires improvements in the external efﬁciency of the microLED. A number of techniques to overcome the limitation of low EQE are discussed in Sec. IVA. B. Angle of extraction One critical metric for non-display applications is the angle of the light emitted from the active region of the microLED source. Planar microLEDs exhibit a Lambertian output distribution at the source by default, which is advantageous for wide-viewing applications such as displays.113,114 On the other hand, applications like structured illumination microscopy', '(SIM) require that the light extraction cone be as narrow as possible. A lower numerical aperture (NA) is needed to prevent any light leakage into an adjacent pixel or row.62,63 A nar- rower light beam is also needed to better couple the light into the opti- cal systems and control the optical path.115 A wider extraction cone decreases coupled light into the optical system and, thus, the overall optical efﬁciency of the system. Removing collimating optics, as seen in the system in Fig. 8(a), is advantageous in decreasing the complexity and bulkiness of the system overall.116 Additionally, Sun et al.', 'also showed that the presence of photonic crystals can narrow the light FIG. 7. A schematic diagram showing the concept of escape cone. The escape cone at the semiconductor with refractive index ns and the air with refractive index nair interface is deﬁned by the critical angle. Only the light inside the escape cone is eventually emitted from the active region of the microLED; everything else is reﬂected back into the semiconductor and reabsorbed, leading to a low extraction efﬁciency.

C. Modulation bandwidth The bandwidth of a', 'communication system is a key determining factor of its maximum achievable data transfer rate. In this context, the 3-dB modulation bandwidth of microLEDs is the most important factor for visible light communication systems as an optical signal emitter. The modulation bandwidth is determined by the carrier life- time of the emitter and the RC time constant, where R is the differen- tial resistance and C is the device capacitance.36,37 The lower RC values of microLEDs arising from their small size and short carrier lifetime result in a high modulation bandwidth that can easily reach several hundred MHz.37,119,120 A plot of', 'modulation bandwidth against current density for various mesa dimensions is shown in Fig. 9. The modulation bandwidth initially increases with the current density because carrier lifetime is the dominant factor determining the band- width. At a higher current density, the RC time constant becomes a dominant factor limiting the current density.121,122 At the desired cur- rent density, either one of the dominant factors can be improved to increase the modulation bandwidth for the VLC system. D. Emission wavelength Tuning microLED light emission to a particular wavelength is highly desirable for many non-display applications.20,55,58,98,123 Apart from the need for red, green,', 'and blue emissions for full-color microLEDs displays, it is also required for solid-state lighting and white light communication systems.124,125 There are three primary ways to modify light emission wavelength: through phosphors, using quantum dots (QDs), or by changing the compound semiconductor layer itself.126–129 These techniques are discussed in detail in Sec. IVC. The wavelength of the light emitted from the microLEDs is also an important factor for optogenetic stimulations. The light-sensitive pro- teins, i.e., opsins, are sensitive only to a certain range of wavelengths. It is important to match light emission to the maximally sensitive wave- length of these proteins.130', 'For example, channelrhodopsins (ChRs) absorption peaks range from 440 to 590 nm, and other retinal-binding proteins show peaks from 630 to 644 nm.131–136 Emission wavelength is similarly important for photolithographic applications because pho- toresist must be exposed at wavelengths in the UV region for proper development.137,138 E. Light Output Power (LOP) The light output power of microLEDs is one the most important factors for applications including solid-state lighting, optogenetics, imaging, and photolithography.21,97,139,140 The light-output power of microLEDs initially increases as we increase injected current density but then saturates and further decreases as the current density is increased.139,141 This is due', 'to the self-heating effect that causes increased non-radiative recombination and carrier leakage.141,142 As mentioned earlier, in optogenetics applications, there is a minimum light output power required at the neurons for the photosensitive pro- teins to stimulate action potentials.111,112 Even though microLEDs can operate at much higher current densities (>1 kA/cm2) than LEDs, the total light output power (LOP) is smaller due to their small size.143 If an optogenetic application requires deeper tissue stimulation, the opti- cal output power of microLEDs becomes even more important.134 Thicker photoresists used in photolithography also require higher light output power for adequate exposure.137 IV. OPTICAL', 'STRUCTURES FOR IMPROVED PERFORMANCE Despite the superior performance of microLEDs when compared with OLEDs, modiﬁcation in the key properties of microLEDs is often required for non-display applications. Electro-optical components such as photonic crystals, nanostructures, microlenses, Fresnel lenses, quantum dots, phosphors, etc., are integrated with the traditional microLEDs to improve the output performance. Key optical compo- nents that can enhance the performance metrics of microLEDs and make them more suitable for use in non-display applications are dis- cussed in Secs. IVA–V. A. Extraction efficiency enhancement The low extraction efﬁciency of microLEDs originates from the traditionally grown epilayer structure of the GaN', 'LEDs.6,106,144 A typi- cal GaN epi structure is grown hetero-epitaxially on a sapphire sub- strate due to the lack of availability of a suitable substrate for homoepitaxial growth.145,146 The photons generated inside the GaN FIG. 9. A graph showing the 3-dB modulation bandwidth of microLEDs as a func- tion of current density for different pixel sizes ranging from 60 to 160 lm. The mod- ulation bandwidth initially increases as the current density of microLED increases and then saturates for higher current density operation. The smaller pixel sizes achieve higher modulation bandwidth as they can be operated at higher current density.', 'The markers on the plot denote the maximal modulation bandwidth in the measurement for each size.

This consequently reduces the overall efﬁciency of the extracted light.147 Researchers have suggested methods including chip', 'shaping, photonic crystals, surface roughness, and mesa shape modiﬁcation to improve the extraction efﬁciency of microLEDs.148–152 This section discusses the techniques for extraction efﬁciency enhancement in the context of various non-display applications. 1. Photonic crystals Photonic crystals (PhCs) are repeated dielectric structures of length scales similar to the wavelength of light.148,153,154 These crystals have the capability to modify spontaneous light emission by creating a photonic bandgap that can interact with the electronic bandgap of the emission material.155 The photonic bandgap can be utilized in two ways to increase the extraction efﬁciency: inhibiting the emission of the guided modes or redirecting', 'trapped light into radiated modes. The photonic crystals should be physically very close to the active light emitting region to maximize their impact. Wierer et al. demonstrated electrically operated InGaN/GaN LEDs with photonic crystals having a tunnel junction to provide lateral current spreading to the photonics crystals.154 This work reports increased microLED radiance and an approximately 1.5x total increase in light extraction with photonic crystals incorporation. Additionally, the far-ﬁeld radiation pattern of LEDs with PhC was also radically different than planar LEDs.154 Oder et al. demonstrated extraction efﬁciency enhancement of 63% in InGaN/GaN blue (460 nm) microLEDs and 95% in', 'AlInGaN/ GaN UV (340 nm) microLEDs. These results were achieved by pat- terning triangular arrays of photonic crystals with electron beam lithography.156 Meanwhile, Kim et al. reported GaN LEDs with square-lattice 2D photonics crystals patterned using laser holography (LH) method suitable for high-throughput and large area process- ing.157 Figure 10(a) shows the photonic crystals and the schematic dia- gram of the fabricated device. Enhancement in the light output of up to 2.6\\x02 is observed in the device integrated with photonic crystals of lattice constant 500 nm, as seen in Fig. 10(b). In other works, research- ers have fabricated photonic crystals', 'on pGaN using monomer-based nanoimprint lithography. These LEDs showed a 2.6\\x02 times increase in photoluminescent intensity compared to LEDs without the pho- tonic crystal patterns.158 McGroddy et al. reported increased directional emission by 3.5\\x02 using optimized 2D photonic crystals.159 These devices have additional index guiding layers in the vertical direction that take advantage of directionality and guided mode control.159 Photonics crystal-based LEDs rivaling the best of the non-photonic-crystal LEDs have also been shown along with the theoretical electromagnetic calculations matching the measured results.148 Photonic crystals fabricated on the top of the surface of LEDs suffers from limited interaction with lower', 'order modes resulting in a poor extraction of a relatively high portion of light carried by low order modes.160,161 Matioli et al. proposed embedded air-gap PhCs within the LEDs for much greater interaction with low order modes to improve extraction efﬁciency further.153 Improvements as much as 8.3\\x02 has been shown using complex pho- tonic structures through simulations in the recent past.149 2. Surface roughness Textured, rough surfaces increase the extraction efﬁciency of microLEDs by increasing the angular randomness of the photons inside the light emitting diode. This randomization provides multiple opportunities for the photons to enter the escape cone.162 Various', 'research groups have reported on increasing light extraction efﬁciency using surface roughness.162–171 Schnitzer et al. demonstrated an EQE of 30% using a textured surface and a rear metallic reﬂector to enhance angular randomization.162 Windisch et al. experimentally investigated the transmission properties of a textured surface to achieve 2\\x02 increase in angle-average transmission and used it to achieve 46% external extraction efﬁciency in unencapsulated light emitting diodes.163 Other methods created textured surfaces with natural FIG. 10.

While it is easier to roughen the pGaN surface at the top, Fuji et al. were able to use ﬂip-chip bonding and laser liftoff (LLO) to access the nGaN sur- face for roughening. They demonstrated a 2.3\\x02 improvement in the total output power compared to that of a non-roughened LED.165 Figure 11 shows the roughened nGaN surface and the resulting improvement in the performance of an LED with the increase in sur- face roughness.165 Double-sided roughening of both the pGaN layer and the undoped layer can increase the randomization of the photons and further', 'improve light output.166 Chang et al. went beyond the typ- ical etching process and used femtosecond laser ablation to create nanostructures on the surface to increase light output from LEDs by 18%.169 A recent computational study comparing the effectiveness of surface roughening with that of integrating photonic crystals shows that photonic crystals can create higher light extraction improvements, but the ease of fabrication to create surface roughness still makes it a compelling method to improve light extraction from light emitting diodes.170 3. Patterned Sapphire Substrate (PSS) Light emitting diodes grown on commonly used c-plane sapphire substrates suffer from high defect', 'density in epilayers due to a large mismatch between the lattice constant and thermal expansion coefﬁ- cients of sapphire and GaN.144 These differences are responsible for degrading external quantum efﬁciency.144 Patterned sapphire sub- strates (PSS) featuring different types of artiﬁcial structures have achieved notable progress toward solving these problems.140,173–175 The microscale structures are generally created using conventional dry etching or wet etching methods; and nanoscale structures are fabri- cated using nanospheres, nanoimprint lithography, or anodic alumi- num oxide techniques.176–180 PSS have several advantages over ﬂat sapphire substrates. PSS provides a versatile platform for the growth of visible and UV epilayer', 'structures, requires no interruption during the growth process, reduces the density of threading dislocation in epi- layers, and enhances light extraction efﬁciency due to the increased probability of light scattering.181 PSS has also been shown to suppress the quantum conﬁned stark effect (QCSE) and improve UV-LED external efﬁciency.182–184 Figure 12 shows a UV-LED with PSS incor- porated.182 As seen in the comparison plot, UV-LED with PSS has a higher output power than a conventional LED at the same injected current. The origin of the improved light output power is attributed to the reduction in threading dislocation (TD) induced non-radiative recombination', 'as well as enhanced light extraction due to scattering. Increased light output power with pyramidal patterns at both micro- and nanoscale has been reported.185 Nanoscale patterns show more improvement in output power than microscale patterns. PSS growth techniques, shape, pattern size, spacing, aspect ratio, and other param- eters have considerable inﬂuence on epilayer quality and eventual LED performance. A detailed review of the subject has been presented in the literature.181 B. Beam shaping Planar microLEDs have a Lambertian light output distribu- tion.113,114 The luminous intensity of a Lambertian surface is propor- tional to the cosine of the angle between the', 'observed direction and the surface normal. The radiant intensity of such a surface is the same when viewed from any angle. Uniform radiant intensity is advanta- geous for wide viewing applications such as displays or TVs. Other non-display applications such as SIM, optogenetic stimulation, or FIG. 11. (a) Schematic diagram of light emitting diode with surface roughening of nGaN.

Microlens Microlens arrays have been investigated for their focusing ability to achieve uniform far-ﬁeld illumination of targets with laser beams in the past.188 The microscale curved surface of the microlens allows it to focus divergent beamlets onto the illumination plane. B€ uttner et al. analyzed the beam shaping property of optical systems consisting of light-emitting diode and microlens arrays.189 An integrated microlens array consisting of 128 \\x02 96 elements at the bottom of', 'a microLED array was shown to enable well-resolved light that prevented optical crosstalk.190 The microlens was fabricated using a reﬂow method fol- lowed by etching the sapphire to transfer the pattern with an RMS roughness of less than 3 nm. Low roughness is needed for optically high-quality microlenses. Figures 13(a) and 13(b) show the schematic diagram of the integrated device and an image demonstrating the focusing ability of the microlens, respectively. Zhu et al. reported fabri- cating microlens arrays with UV-microLEDs as exposure sources. In far-ﬁeld emissions measurements, the integrated device showed a sig- niﬁcant reduction in light divergence.186 The', 'divergence half-angle was reduced by 22\\x03. The incorporation of silica/polystyrene (PS) colloidal microlens array on the top of microLEDs has been shown to increase light extrac- tion at higher angular directions with increased PS thickness and to decrease divergence of light output at smaller PS thicknesses.191 To fur- ther control beam shaping from light emitting diodes, an optical ele- ment combining a Fresnel lens with a microlens array design has been designed and studied for controlling on-axis and off-axis LED emission for lighting applications.192 Continuing on the trend of integrating opti- cal components with LEDs/microLEDs, a combination of total internal', 'reﬂection (TIR) lenses, a reﬂective cavity, and a microlens array plate has been proposed for uniform street lighting using LEDs.193 Additionally, Park et al. created a new type of compact optical element that combined a pair of microlens arrays for light collimation from micro-displays for the application of using microLEDs for near-eye dis- plays.194 Demory et al. demonstrated HWHM linewidth reduction of 50% in far-ﬁeld emission divergence by integrating nearly ﬂat parabolic nanolenses on the top of nanopillar microLEDs.187 This demonstrates the potential for reducing the size and weight of collimation and projec- tion optics by incorporating microlens arrays. 2.', 'TIR Fresnel lens A Fresnel lens is a compact lens that is made up of a set of con- centric annular sections.195 These sections can be viewed as divided surfaces of a standard lens with the same curvature and stepwise dis- continuities between them.

To close this gap, Joo et al. proposed a TIR Fresnel lens for a miniature electro-optical system that could collimate emitted light from LEDs more effectively.200 The designed lens had a diameter of less than 1 mm and 11 facets on a sin- gle side. It successfully reduced the emission solid angle from 60\\x03 to 12\\x03. Researchers have also investigated an electro-optical system that integrated a TIR Fresnel lens into the packaging microlens of LEDs, which can beneﬁt systems that require focused and narrow microLED light emission.201 The work explored the inﬂuence of structural parameters,', 'namely, the height-to-width ratio of the 3D Fresnel-based lens, on beam shaping and showed improved narrowing of the emitted light beam.201 While a Fresnel lens is well-suited to collimate light sources, cer- tain applications requiring uniform lighting from multiple light sour- ces need further re-direction of the light beam.192,193 Wang et al. proposed an optical element that combined a Fresnel lens and a microlens to achieve light collimation and further re-direction of colli- mated rays, respectively.192 The proposed design method is versatile with no limitation on the source intensity pattern. The resulting opti- cal element is compact and lightweight. A', 'major challenge of creating optical systems that use a Fresnel lens for beam shaping is the mathe- matical complexity and intricate optimizations.202,203 One proposed method tackles this issue by using geometric optics analysis to simplify the design process of a free-form lens system. The free-form lens con- sisted of a TIR collimator and Fresnel exit lens to produce speciﬁc LED intensity distribution.204 Another challenge for LEDs application is the limited optical power output from a single LED.193 This requires using an array of LEDs/microLEDs to obtain higher optical power. These further need integration with an array of lens systems. Vu', 'et al. presented a design for uniform lighting applications that consisted of a collimating pla- no–convex lens array and two perpendicularly-placed linear Fresnel lenses.205 The physical layout of the illumination system and the simu- lation results showing uniform lighting is shown in Fig. 14. While the integration of TIR Fresnel lens systems and LEDs offers solutions to many of the challenges associated with beam shaping, the complex process of design and implementation signiﬁcantly increases the cost of electro-optical systems. The addition of optical elements as a part of LED packaging can signiﬁcantly address some of these challenges. A detailed review', 'of the optical designs for the LED packaging by Nian et al. can be referred to for further insight.206 C. Wavelength management techniques There are different techniques that are used to get multiple wave- length emissions from microLEDs. One of the most common methods is to change the material composition of the compound semiconduc- tor layer. It is done by incorporating higher indium (In) content in the InGaN/GaN alloy which changes the crystal structure and eventually FIG. 14.

In addition to modifying the lattice constant of the material, adding quantum dots (QD) or phosphors to the', 'mesa surface of microLEDs could enable a single- colored pixel to emit multiple colors.207,208 All three methods to achieve different wavelength emissions are discussed in this section. Other techniques such as quantum well (QW) thickness-dependent InGaN/GaN multiple quantum wells (MQW), microfacet emission from MQW, nanowires, and local strain engineering have also been explored in the literature for wavelength tuning in microLEDs.209–213 1. Colloidal Quantum Dots (QDs) QDs are nanoscale semiconductor crystals with distinct proper- ties from those of bulk semiconductors.214,215 Each QD consists of a small inorganic semiconductor core (1–10 nm), a wider-bandgap semiconductor shell, and a coating of passivating', 'ligands.216,217 An atomic force microscopy (AFM) height image of a closely packed monolayer of QDs is shown in Fig. 15(c). One of the most useful prop- erties of these nanocrystals is the tunability of their bandgap by varying their size and discrete energy levels also called the quantum conﬁned effect.215,218 Figure 15(a) shows QD solutions of various sizes and composition exhibiting photoluminescence under UV light. Figure 15(b) shows the PL spectra of QDs with narrowband emission from visible to NIR. Several advantageous properties of QDs such as narrow emission linewidth (20–30 nm for CdSe), high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY >', '90%), high photostability, and solution processability make them attractive for applications with microLEDs.126,219 CdSe, with an emission linewidth of 20–30 nm, and PbS are the most commonly used materials for the core of the QDs for visible wavelength and NIR devices, respectively.214,220,221 As mentioned in the application section, microLEDs are used in VLC systems to achieve higher bandwidth and data transfer speeds. This has motivated the adoption of white light microLEDs with larger pixel sizes of 100 lm into VLC systems to achieve higher data transfer rates without complicated signal processing.120 As a result, it has become essential to ﬁnd', 'a white light source with wavelength multi- plexing ability for VLC systems. Recently, researchers have explored QD-based white light microLEDs for VLC applications. Mei et al. demonstrated a white light system that used Perovskite QDs for a high bandwidth VLC system.124 They showed 80 \\x02 80 lm2 microLEDs having a modulation bandwidth of 160 MHz and a peak emission wavelength of approximately 445 nm. They achieve bandwidths of up to 85 MHz without ﬁlters or equalization in the white-light system. The system showed a maximum data transfer rate of 300 Mbps using a non-return-to-zero on-off keying (NRZ-OOK) modulation scheme. QD-based', 'microLED arrays for bi-directional optogenetics applications have also been reported.222 They used QDs to create a dual-colored microLED array with emissions at 462 and 623nm. This further elucidates the use of QDs in non-display application technologies. 2. Phosphor Phosphors are color-converting materials that are essential for achieving full color and are a key component of white lighting sys- tems.5,223,224 Generally, phosphors consist of two functional materials, a host material, and an activator material.225 Host materials are often wide bandgap oxides, nitrides, or sulﬁdes and determine the crystal structure of the phosphor.226–228 Activator materials are usually transi- tion metals or rare', 'earth compounds and are responsible for light emission.225 Both materials play critical roles in determining a phos- phor’s photoluminescent properties, such as emission wavelength and quantum efﬁciency. Figure 16(a) shows the crystal structure of a nar- rowband red-emitting phosphor material Sr4[LiAl11N14]:Eu2þ as an example.229 Traditionally, phosphors have been a preferred choice as a down- conversion material for UV-LEDs and blue LEDs to obtain white light sources, due to their high efﬁciency, high stability, and narrow spec- trum.125,229,230 However, phosphors’ larger size can cause signiﬁcant non-uniformity in the color conversion when used with small (50 lm) microLEDs. The size of the', 'phosphor can be varied depending upon the preparation process and nano-sized phosphors can be prepared.231 However, the luminous efﬁciency of the phosphor is proportional to its size, and as a result, nano-sized phosphors have lower luminous efﬁciencies.232 FIG. 15.

Chun et al. presented a high-speed VLC system with a transmission rate of 1.68', 'Gbps at a distance of 3 cm using white light generated by blue GaN microLEDs and a yellow ﬂuo- rescent converter.123 The high transmission speed is attributed to the high modulation bandwidth of the polymer-based yellow ﬂuorescent layer. Huang et al. reported a white light VLC system with a 3-dB modulation bandwidth of 127.3 MHz using blue microLEDs and yel- low phosphor.122 Recently, Chang et al. reported a white light VLC system that used semi-polar blue microLEDs and yellow phosphors to achieve a data rate of 2.805 Gbps.128 The higher data rate and band- width of the system are attributed', 'to the improved radiative efﬁciency of the semi-polar blue microLEDs resulting from the reduced quantum-conﬁned Stark effect (QCSE). A hybrid strategy of mixing small-sized and large-sized phos- phors can improve the non-uniformity of the system to a great extent with only a small reduction in efﬁciency. However, this remains a chal- lenge as mesa dimensions shrink to smaller areas of 5 l m and below.204 Recently, GE has developed a sub-micron sized red phos- phor K2SiF6:Mn4þ (KSF) and KSF inks suitable for microLEDs that can be deposited by low-cost methods such as ink-jet printing, slot die coating, or spin coating.233', 'These recent developments pave the way for phosphors to be further utilized in microLED applications by over- coming challenges due to their size. 3. Compound semiconductor layers Electroluminescence, which is responsible for spontaneous light emission upon the passage of electric current, dates back to 1907 when Round discovered it in silicon carbide (SiC) crystals.234 Further under- standing of materials and luminescent phenomena makes tuning of bandgap an obvious choice for the creation of light emitting diodes of different colors.235–238 Red LEDs have traditionally used AlGaInP crystals, but recent focus has shifted to indium gallium nitride (InGaN) crystals as they offer', 'a wide spectral range from ultraviolet to infrared.239 InGaN bandgap energy can be tuned from 0.67 to 3.42 eV by changing the composition of the alloy.129,240,241 Figure 17 shows the energy bandgap of hexagonal gallium nitride (h-GaN) as a func- tion of lattice constant that is controlled by the indium (In) concentra- tion in the alloy. The external quantum efﬁciency (EQE) of the microLED decreases with decreasing device size due to the increased non- radiative recombination, also known as efﬁciency droop.100 While the peak EQE of a 20 \\x02 20 lm blue microLED has been reported to be as high', 'as 33%, AlGaInP-based red microLEDs suffer signiﬁcantly from efﬁciency droop due to high surface recombination and long carrier lifetime at smaller dimensions (<50 lm).242–244 They also suffer from poor thermal stability at high temperatures.245,246 This has resulted in a growing interest in creating red microLEDs that are based on III- nitride materials, in particular InGaN.247,248 The EQE of red InGaN FIG. 16.

The activation or suppression of different cells expressed by different proteins is highly desirable for more precise control over the neuronal activity. Red-and-blue-colored microLED-based optoelectronic probes have been used to demonstrate bi-directional neuronal activity manipulation.251,252 Dual-colored microLED arrays have also been used as VLC transmitters and dem- onstrated error-free data rates of 1.79–3.35 Gbps in', 'a dual-wavelength multiplexing scheme.253 Further work is needed to enhance the efﬁ- ciency of longer wavelength microLEDs as longer wavelengths enable deeper neural cell stimulation in optogenetics and wavelength division multiplexing in VLC systems.254,255 V. OUTLOOK AND CHALLENGES As discussed in the article, MicroLED/LED technology has been incorporated into a range of applications beyond display applications. MicroLEDs based on InGaN/GaN have consistently higher efﬁciencies than competing approaches even as we scale down the device dimen- sions to sub-micron size for blue, green, and red emissions. The efﬁ- ciency of the red-colored InGaN/GaN microLEDs can stand further improvement, especially at smaller', 'dimensions. The ability to achieve RGB emission from a single material stack will open a wide array of applications with increasingly complex system integration. Additionally, the relatively high cost of GaN epi wafers remains a chal- lenge to be addressed, as microLED technology is adopted into a greater number of applications such as point-of-care medical applica- tions like phototherapy and skin treatments.256,257 The adoption of microLEDs in visible light communication (VLC) systems has rapidly grown with improved data transfer rates. An increase in the modulation bandwidth is the driving factor for the higher data transfer rates. Device miniaturization and the', 'decrease in carrier lifetime of microLEDs can further improve this trend. Additionally, VLC systems that use an array of microLEDs as emitters have the potential to enhance the data transfer rates even higher, albeit with the increased system complexity. Implementation of VLC in lab- oratory setup is routinely demonstrated, but the real-life system still remains a challenge. Many critical issues such as reliability, scalability, and compactness related to the commercialization of the VLC systems remain to be addressed. As optogenetics advances our understanding of neural circuits, microLEDs will have an increasingly prevalent role in delivering spa- tially resolved single-neuron stimulation.', 'This would require scaling down microLEDs further along and improving external efﬁciency to be able to deliver enough light irradiation to create action potentials. The mesa size-related efﬁciency droop needs to be further improved. Closed loop stimulation and monitoring of a large ensemble of neu- rons would require large-scale device fabrication. Integration with microLED drivers and electrode arrays also needs to be addressed. As microLEDs are scaled down to the nanoscale, they will have the potential for an entirely new concept of microscopy, NIM with resolu- tion capabilities surpassing the diffraction limit. However, as the microLEDs are miniaturized to nanoscale', 'dimensions, increased non- radiative recombination due to the larger surface-to-volume ratio of the mesa becomes a challenge.15,16 Various mesa sidewall passivation methods, such as dielectric (e.g., SiO2, Al2O3) deposition using plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) and atomic layer deposition (ALD), acid-base etching, hydrogen plasma, and sul- fur treatments, are suggested ways to minimize non-radiative recombi- nation and improve the external quantum efﬁciency.258–261 Progress toward improving the extraction efﬁciency of LEDs using photonic crystals and beam shaping using microlenses has been made, but challenges related to reliable integration with microLEDs remain to be addressed. The most common microlens fabrication technique (as', 'the reﬂow method) faces uniformity and control chal- lenges that need to be improved. The fabrication of high-quality opti- cal microlenses to minimize scattering is also a challenge. Photonic crystal fabrication often requires using electron beam lithography which is expensive and offers a low throughput. Simpler and more reliable fabrication techniques need to be developed for further inte- gration with microLEDs and to enable more widespread utilization of these advanced methods. The ability to modify the electro-optical properties of microLEDs using various techniques has the potential to enable even more appli- cations beyond displays. MicroLEDs can be used further as', 'active ele- ments in chemical sensors for environmental monitoring and optically activating gas sensors to enable room temperature gas sensing.262–264 The potential of microLEDs as a light source for various computa- tional microscopy techniques further remains to be explored. More research into eliminating size-scaling related efﬁciency droop as well as compatibility and integration with silicon processing needs to be undertaken to further reduce cost and improve integration. These advances will give a much-needed boost to the InGaN/GaN based microLED technology and help develop additional applications with the potential to be ubiquitous in everyday life.

INTRODUCTION\\nThe light emitting diodes (LEDs) based on InGaN/GaN se', 'micon-\\nductors have become ubiquitous. These devices are an integral part of\\nthe solid-state lighting ecosystem including automobiles, smartphones,\\nhome lighting systems, and industrial lighting.1–5 The adoption of\\nLEDs has enabled additional functionalities in the form of longer life-\\ntime, more reliable operation, smaller form factor, and lower power\\nconsumption in almost every application.\\nMuch of the effort toward cost reduction in LEDs has been\\nfocused on increasing external efﬁciency using', ' improved material\\ngrowth techniques and optimizing fabrication processes.6 The reduc-\\ntion in high costs of GaN semiconductor-based light emitting diodes is\\na challenge that needs to be addressed.

A number of these char-\\nacteristics are especially highly desirable in displays for augmented\\nreality (AR) and virtual reality (V', 'R) applications. There are multiple\\nnext-generation display demonstrations in the commercial sector.\\nSamsung demonstrated a microLED display of 292 inches at CES\\n2020.12 Jade Bird has demonstrated a microdisplay of 0.3 in. with 5000\\nPPI for AR/VR applications.13 Recently, Compound Photonics\\nunveiled a microdisplay with a record resolution of 8424 PPI.14 The\\nwide interest from the commercial sector to push for the next genera-\\ntion of display technologies using microLEDs has propelled the\\nresearc', 'h effort into improving the key microLED characteristics such\\nas efﬁciency, brightness, full-color emission, and lifetime.\\nWhile microLEDs have been receiving signiﬁcant commercial\\ninterest for their use as emitters for display technology, little commer-\\ncial focus has been applied to microLEDs for non-display applications,\\nwhich is an active area of research (see Fig. 1). While high information\\ncontent displays require a high resolution and small pixels, which can\\nlead to challenges including r', 'educed efﬁciency due to greater non-\\nradiative recombination, higher current density, and degraded extrac-\\ntion,15–18 many of the reviewed non-display applications can beneﬁt\\nfrom single pixel control and take advantage of relatively efﬁcient,\\nlarger pixels. Future applications, especially in areas that beneﬁt from\\nultra-small (e.g., sub micrometer) LEDs, experience some of these\\nchallenges and are brieﬂy also discussed. MicroLEDs are increasingly\\nbeing used as a signal emitter in visible light ', 'communication (VLC)\\nsystems due to their high modulation bandwidth and ability to offer\\nparallel channels for communication using microLED array.19–21\\nMicroLEDs are also well-suited for optogenetic stimulation, requiring\\na spatially resolved high-intensity light source.22–24 Multiple computa-\\ntional microscopy techniques, such as structured illumination micros-\\ncopy (SIM), for neural imaging have also used microLEDs as light\\nsources.25,26 The high intensity emission in the UV-blue spectrum also\\n', 'makes microLEDs suitable for maskless lithography.27 These non-\\ndisplay applications often require modiﬁcation in the electro-optical\\ncharacteristics of microLEDs. Performance characteristics such as\\nmodulation bandwidth, light output power, emission wavelength, and\\nextraction efﬁciency are tailored by integrating additional optical and\\nelectrical structures (see Fig. 1). The fabrication of the optical struc-\\ntures requires more processing on the top of the microLED structure.\\nDespite the progre', 'ss in fabrication capabilities, a number of challenges\\nremain to be addressed for these applications.\\nIn this review, we explore microLED electro-optical characteris-\\ntics needed for non-display applications. We ﬁrst discuss multiple\\nnon-display application areas highlighting key past results and ongo-\\ning research work. We then examine the performance metrics critical\\nfor the non-display applications. Deﬁnitions of the key metrics from a\\nnon-display application point of view are presented.

The schematic diagram encom-\\npassing the review is shown in Fig. 1.\\nII. NON-DISPLAY APPLICATION AREAS\\nMicroLEDs have been extensively explored as pixels for next-\\ngeneration displays with ultra-high brightness, deeper color gamut,\\nand longer lifetime.28–31 The high luminance, energy efﬁciency, reli-\\nability, low cost, and bio-compatibility of microLEDs also ', 'enable them\\nto be used in various non-display technologies such as visible light\\ncommunications (VLC), photolithography, optogenetics stimulation,\\nlight sources for structured illumination microscopy (SIM), and super-\\nresolution imaging.22,25–27,32,33 This section focuses on the system\\nsetup and recent progress of each of these applications.\\nA. Visible Light Communication (VLC)\\nThe usage of microLEDs in visible light communication (VLC)\\nsystems has been investigated both as emitter devices and a', 's photode-\\ntectors (PD).19–21,34 The VLC system, shown in Fig. 2(c), consists of\\nthree primary components: an optical transmitter, an optical channel,\\nand a receiver.35 The optical transmitter contains the waveform gener-\\nator, encoders, driver electronics, microLED emitters, and transmitter\\noptics. The optical channel allows for data transfer through air or\\nanother desired medium. The receiver contains receiver optics, photo-\\ndetectors, ampliﬁers, and decoders. The schematic diagram of a mea-\\ns', 'urement setup for frequency response characterization having similar\\ncomponents is also shown in Fig. 2(a).\\nThe lower RC values of microLEDs arising from their small size\\n(1–100 lm) and short carrier lifetime result in a high modulation\\nbandwidth. A higher 3-dB modulation bandwidth allows a higher data\\nrate transfer in the communication system. These characteristics make\\nmicroLEDs an attractive choice for optical data emitters in high-speed\\nFIG. 2. The schematic diagram of a visible light commun', 'ication (VLC) system.

Mckendry et al. demonstrated a\\ndata transfer speed of 1 Gbps in 2010 using an individually addressable\\n16 \\x02 16 microLED array with 72 l m diameter pixel size.19 The blue\\nemitter of wavelength 450 nm showed a 3-dB modulation bandwidth\\nof 245 MHz. In 2020, Xie et al. demonstrated a record data transfer\\nrate of 11.7 Gbps using a series-biased blue 3', ' \\x02 3 microLED array.38\\nThis array featured smaller 20 lm diameter elements, generated over\\n10 mW of optical power, and displayed a high 3-dB modulation band-\\nwidth of 980 MHz.\\nMany modulation schemes can be used to encode the data in the\\nVLC systems. Most microLED VLC systems report implementing one\\nof three key modulation schemes: Pulse Amplitude Modulation\\n(PAM), On-Off Key (OOK), or Orthogonal Frequency Division\\nMultiplexing (OFDM). The selection of one method depends on the\\nprioritization of', ' complexity or efﬁciency requirements. A detailed dis-\\ncussion of modulation schemes in VLC systems can be found in the\\ncomprehensive text by Nan Chi (2018).39 The use of pixels with\\nincreasingly small diameters (tens of micrometers) to achieve\\nimproved data transfer rates of more than 10 Gbps in VLC systems is\\nan encouraging sign that next-generation communication systems\\ncould be successfully implemented using microLED technology.\\nB. Optogenetic stimulation\\nOptogenetics, the technique by which', ' light is used to selectively\\nstimulate neural cells, has revolutionized the ﬁeld of neuroscience.40–47\\nIt is a most widely used method to study the causal relationship\\nbetween neural circuits and behavior.46 Researchers have explored\\nusing various light transmission methods, including ﬁber optic cables\\nand waveguides, to deliver stimuli to speciﬁc neuron cell popula-\\ntions.48–51 These approaches can stimulate a large number of neural\\ncells, but struggle to deliver light at a high spatial resolu', 'tion, a key\\nrequirement for decoding neural circuits. Grossman et al. proposed a\\nsimple solution to this problem by creating an array of microLEDs\\ncapable of generating arbitrary optical excitation patterns on neuronal\\nsamples with high resolution.52 This concept of matrix photostimula-\\ntion is illustrated in Fig. 3(a). A light-sensitive ion channel known as\\nchannelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) provides a powerful tool for millisecond\\nneural excitation.40 ChR2 expressing neural cells are covered with\\nmicro', 'LEDs that each has individual control over their illumination\\nintensity and timing for optical excitation.\\nTo gain a fuller understanding of the causal relationship between\\nneuronal circuits and their behavior, simultaneous localized stimula-\\ntion and electrical recording of neural cells are required. Such an\\nexperimental setup then must address the additional challenge of\\ndirectly integrating light sources onto the stimulation sites. Scalable\\ndesigns that monolithically integrate microLEDs and ', 'recording sites\\nonto silicon neural probes can solve this problem to enable closed-\\nloop light stimulation and electrical recordings.53–55 Figure 3(b) shows\\nthe 48 microLED probe used by Wu et al. to independently stimulate\\ndistinct cells spaced 50 l m apart.53 Neural recordings from a freely\\nmoving mouse using this probe are also shown. Scharf et al. used a\\nsimilar approach but increased their system’s scalability by integrating\\nFIG. 3.

McAlinden et al. further scaled the optrode\\narray by creating a device with the capability to deliver light stimuli at\\n181 sites. This milestone was achieved by a novel fabrication method\\nfor microLEDs on GaN-on-Sapphire with glass microneedle.56\\nTethered neural stimulation restricts the free movement of\\nrodents. To enable untethere', 'd, remote-controlled neural stimulation\\nand electrochemical sensing of freely moving mice, Liu et al. developed\\nwireless, implantable probes with microLEDs for optogenetic stimula-\\ntion and dopamine detection.57 While these devices provide a high pre-\\ncision spatiotemporal stimulation method, they can cause undesirable\\nstimulation artifacts with high enough amplitudes to mask neuronal\\nactivities.53 Kim et al. demonstrated opto-electrodes capable of eliminat-\\ning electromagnetic interference (EMI', ') induced and photovoltaic (PV)\\nrelated stimulation artifacts using multi-layer metal structures and\\nheavily boron-doped silicon substrates, respectively.58 The application\\nof microLEDs in optogenetic stimulation is paving the way for studies\\nof freely moving rodents’ neuronal circuits by providing compact optro-\\ndes that are essential for decoding the neural basis of behavior.\\nC. Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM)\\nStructured illumination microscopy (SIM) allows optical section-\\ning imagin', 'g (OS-SIM) and/or super-resolution imaging (SR-SIM) of\\nneural cells by modifying conventional microscopes.59–63 It has\\nbecome a widely utilized method. Its widespread use can be attributed\\nto its relatively simple setup, which enables wideﬁeld imaging and inte-\\ngration with traditional microscopes. Structured illumination micros-\\ncopy (SIM) uses the principle that higher spatial frequencies attenuate\\nfaster with defocus than lower spatial frequencies. For an illuminated\\nsample with a grid projec', 'tion, the modulation in the out-of-focus part\\nof the image attenuates faster than the thin in-focus part of the image.\\nThe optically sectioned part of the image can be extracted by looking\\nat the modulation part in the image. Figure 4(a) demonstrates how the\\noptically sectioned part of the image can be extracted from the modu-\\nlated image section. The grid moves into three equally spaced posi-\\ntions, sequentially capturing thirds of the image and then combining\\nthem to obtain an optically sectio', 'ned or a super-resolved image.25\\nTraditionally, this has been achieved by placing a grating grid in\\nthe illumination path and then using a piezo-based system to mechan-\\nically move the pattern and obtain phase-shifting.64,65 The mechanical\\nmovement limits the speed and accuracy of the system. Digital micro-\\nmirror device (DMD) based programmable spatial light modulators\\n(SLMs) have been used to replace the gratings and get around the\\naforementioned limitations caused by slow mechanical move-\\nmen', 't.26,66–68 These systems use lamp or LED based illumination.\\nHowever, controlling illumination patterns using DMD increases the\\ncomplexity of the system due to the added optical elements and\\nincreased optical path. They also suffer from the blazed grating effect\\nthat causes SIM patterns with varying intensity distribution.69,70 The\\nresulting SIM patterns are prone to reconstruction artifacts. Using\\nelectrically programmable microLED arrays for patterned illumination\\nis an efﬁcient, low-cost solu', 'tion with no moving parts in a system.\\nMicroLED based structural illumination also provides additional bin-\\nning capabilities for the illumination pattern. Figure 4(b) shows a\\nmicroscope setup developed by Poher et al. for optical sectioning using\\na microLED strip array as a light source.25 The ability to use the same\\nmicroscope for the implementation of multiple imaging methods\\ndemonstrate a clear advantage of optical designs that use microLED\\narray as a pattern illumination source. In addition', ', microLED-based\\nlight source systems could be miniaturized sufﬁciently to be used in\\nminiscope designs for the neural imaging of freely moving mice which\\nis essential for understanding the brain circuitry. A more detailed\\nreview of the SIM technique can be found in the cited articles.71–73\\nD.

This method\\nof c', 'omputational imaging allows label-free multi-contrast, i.e., bright-\\nﬁeld, darkﬁeld, phase contrast, and Fourier ptychography imaging to\\nbe combined on a single platform. Brightﬁeld contrast imaging is used\\nto image samples with strong absorption, darkﬁeld contrast is better\\nsuited for sub-resolution features, and phase contrast is primarily uti-\\nlized for a transparent sample.78 As different contrast modes provide\\ndifferent information about a sample, it is desirable to have all the\\nimaging mod', 'es on a single hardware platform.\\nIn traditional microscopy methods, different imaging techniques\\nrequire hardware changes in the microscopy setup, while LED array\\nmicroscopy provides a way to obtain different imaging modalities\\nusing a post-processing imaging algorithm without any change in the\\nhardware. Figure 5(a) shows a time-multiplexing scheme implemented\\nusing LED arrays to obtain multi-contrast imaging. Even though these\\nmethods only require the modiﬁcation of conventional microscopes to', '\\nachieve different imaging techniques, optical components such as\\nlenses and objectives make it bulky and expensive. For this reason,\\nlens-free microscopy systems utilizing LEDs as light sources have\\nbecome widely popular alternatives.80–84 This system consists of a\\nknown and a partially coherent light source for sample illumination\\nand an image sensor for collecting the shadow image, which is then\\nused to reconstruct the full image. Removing the objective lens from\\nthe optical path provides a w', 'ay to decouple the ﬁeld of view (FOV)\\nand resolution. In decoupled lens-free systems, the resolution is lim-\\nited by the pixel size, and the FOV is determined by the active area of\\nthe image sensor. The current resolution is limited to around 1 lm.85\\nThis limitation can be mitigated by using techniques such as pixel\\nsuper-resolution at the expense of a more complex setup.82\\nThe spatial resolution of the traditional optical systems is limited\\ndue to the laws of diffraction inherent to all optical', ' systems.86,87 This\\nlimit is about 200 nm due to Abbe diffraction.88,89 Various super-\\nresolution (SR) techniques, such as photoactivated localization micros-\\ncopy (PALM), stimulated emission depletion microscopy (STED), and\\nstochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), have been\\nexplored to mitigate this fundamental limit.74\\nAnother approach to pushing past this limit using LEDs is emerg-\\ning as the size of the microLEDs decreases toward nanoLEDs.90–92 The\\nsub-micron dimensions of nanoL', 'EDs allow them to serve as spatially\\nresolved light sources and pave the way for Nano Illumination\\nMicroscopy (NIM).93,94 In this technique, spatially resolved light sour-\\nces are used to scan a sample by sequentially illuminating the nanoLED\\narray and recording the optical signal through the sample on highly\\nsensitive image sensors. Figure 5(b) shows how a sample can be imaged\\nby measuring the intensity of light reaching an array of image sensors\\nfrom each individual light source after passing ', 'through the sample. In\\nthis case, the resolution of the system is limited by the pitch of the illu-\\nmination source rather than the detection system. NanoLED arrays\\nwith pitches as small as 70nm have been demonstrated which can lead\\nto a resolution of approximately 140nm which is much improved than\\nthe lens-free approach with resolution limited to around 1l m.85,92\\nWith the absence of bulky lens systems, nanoLED methods could dra-\\nmatically improve the form factor of super-resolution microscopy ', 'and\\nenable a new array of applications in biological imaging.\\nE.

Optical extraction efficiency—EQE vs IQE\\nBlue microLEDs have internal quantum efﬁc', 'iencies (IQEs) that\\ncan exceed ninety percent as a result of advances in growth techniques\\nthat have yielded high-quality materials and crystal structures.100–103\\nHowever, the external quantum efﬁciency (EQE) of GaN-based\\nmicroLEDs, deﬁned as the ratio of the number of photons emitted vs\\nthe number of photons internally generated, is comparatively low with\\na peak EQE of generally smaller than 15%.104–106 The EQE of the\\nmicroLEDs can be viewed as the product of two separate efﬁciencies:\\nIQE and l', 'ight extraction efﬁciency (LEE).107 While IQE is signiﬁcantly\\nimproved over the years, LEE has been a limiting factor.100,108,109 Low\\nLEE is primarily due to the large refractive index difference between\\nair and semiconductors that traps light from total internal reﬂection\\n(TIR) and Fresnel loss at the interface.110 For example, the external\\nefﬁciency could be as low as 4.3% in a typical semiconductor material\\nwith a refractive index of 2.4. Figure 7 graphically demonstrates how\\nonly the light i', 'nside the escape cone, deﬁned by the critical angle, is\\nable to escape. This limitation presents a challenge for microLEDs in\\napplications such as optogenetic stimulation because the photosensi-\\ntive opsins often require minimum irradiance (typically in the range of\\n10–100 mW/cm2 in instantaneous light intensity) to be delivered at\\nthe neurons for activation and ﬂuorescence.111,112 Achieving the\\ndesired optical power numbers with smaller microLEDs requires\\nimprovements in the external efﬁciency ', 'of the microLED. A number\\nof techniques to overcome the limitation of low EQE are discussed in\\nSec. IVA.\\nB. Angle of extraction\\nOne critical metric for non-display applications is the angle of\\nthe light emitted from the active region of the microLED source.\\nPlanar microLEDs exhibit a Lambertian output distribution at the\\nsource by default, which is advantageous for wide-viewing applications\\nsuch as displays.113,114 On the other hand, applications like structured\\nillumination microscopy (SIM) req', 'uire that the light extraction cone\\nbe as narrow as possible. A lower numerical aperture (NA) is needed\\nto prevent any light leakage into an adjacent pixel or row.62,63 A nar-\\nrower light beam is also needed to better couple the light into the opti-\\ncal systems and control the optical path.115 A wider extraction cone\\ndecreases coupled light into the optical system and, thus, the overall\\noptical efﬁciency of the system. Removing collimating optics, as seen\\nin the system in Fig. 8(a), is advantage', 'ous in decreasing the complexity\\nand bulkiness of the system overall.116 Additionally, Sun et al. also\\nshowed that the presence of photonic crystals can narrow the light\\nFIG. 7. A schematic diagram showing the concept of escape cone. The escape\\ncone at the semiconductor with refractive index ns and the air with refractive index\\nnair interface is deﬁned by the critical angle. Only the light inside the escape cone is\\neventually emitted from the active region of the microLED; everything else is\\nreﬂ', 'ected back into the semiconductor and reabsorbed, leading to a low extraction\\nefﬁciency.\\nFIG. 8.

Modulation band', 'width\\nThe bandwidth of a communication system is a key determining\\nfactor of its maximum achievable data transfer rate. In this context,\\nthe 3-dB modulation bandwidth of microLEDs is the most important\\nfactor for visible light communication systems as an optical signal\\nemitter. The modulation bandwidth is determined by the carrier life-\\ntime of the emitter and the RC time constant, where R is the differen-\\ntial resistance and C is the device capacitance.36,37 The lower RC\\nvalues of microLEDs ari', 'sing from their small size and short carrier\\nlifetime result in a high modulation bandwidth that can easily reach\\nseveral hundred MHz.37,119,120 A plot of modulation bandwidth\\nagainst current density for various mesa dimensions is shown in Fig. 9.\\nThe modulation bandwidth initially increases with the current density\\nbecause carrier lifetime is the dominant factor determining the band-\\nwidth. At a higher current density, the RC time constant becomes a\\ndominant factor limiting the current density.', '121,122 At the desired cur-\\nrent density, either one of the dominant factors can be improved to\\nincrease the modulation bandwidth for the VLC system.\\nD. Emission wavelength\\nTuning microLED light emission to a particular wavelength is\\nhighly desirable for many non-display applications.20,55,58,98,123 Apart\\nfrom the need for red, green, and blue emissions for full-color\\nmicroLEDs displays, it is also required for solid-state lighting and\\nwhite light communication systems.124,125 There are three pr', 'imary\\nways to modify light emission wavelength: through phosphors, using\\nquantum dots (QDs), or by changing the compound semiconductor\\nlayer itself.126–129 These techniques are discussed in detail in Sec. IVC.\\nThe wavelength of the light emitted from the microLEDs is also an\\nimportant factor for optogenetic stimulations. The light-sensitive pro-\\nteins, i.e., opsins, are sensitive only to a certain range of wavelengths. It\\nis important to match light emission to the maximally sensitive wave-\\nleng', 'th of these proteins.130 For example, channelrhodopsins (ChRs)\\nabsorption peaks range from 440 to 590 nm, and other retinal-binding\\nproteins show peaks from 630 to 644 nm.131–136 Emission wavelength\\nis similarly important for photolithographic applications because pho-\\ntoresist must be exposed at wavelengths in the UV region for proper\\ndevelopment.137,138\\nE. Light Output Power (LOP)\\nThe light output power of microLEDs is one the most important\\nfactors for applications including solid-state light', 'ing, optogenetics,\\nimaging, and photolithography.21,97,139,140 The light-output power of\\nmicroLEDs initially increases as we increase injected current density\\nbut then saturates and further decreases as the current density is\\nincreased.139,141 This is due to the self-heating effect that causes\\nincreased non-radiative recombination and carrier leakage.141,142 As\\nmentioned earlier, in optogenetics applications, there is a minimum\\nlight output power required at the neurons for the photosensitive pr', 'o-\\nteins to stimulate action potentials.111,112 Even though microLEDs can\\noperate at much higher current densities (>1 kA/cm2) than LEDs, the\\ntotal light output power (LOP) is smaller due to their small size.143 If\\nan optogenetic application requires deeper tissue stimulation, the opti-\\ncal output power of microLEDs becomes even more important.134\\nThicker photoresists used in photolithography also require higher light\\noutput power for adequate exposure.137\\nIV. OPTICAL STRUCTURES FOR IMPROVED\\nPER', 'FORMANCE\\nDespite the superior performance of microLEDs when compared\\nwith OLEDs, modiﬁcation in the key properties of microLEDs is often\\nrequired for non-display applications. Electro-optical components\\nsuch as photonic crystals, nanostructures, microlenses, Fresnel lenses,\\nquantum dots, phosphors, etc., are integrated with the traditional\\nmicroLEDs to improve the output performance. Key optical compo-\\nnents that can enhance the performance metrics of microLEDs and\\nmake them more suitable for us', 'e in non-display applications are dis-\\ncussed in Secs. IVA–V.\\nA. Extraction efficiency enhancement\\nThe low extraction efﬁciency of microLEDs originates from the\\ntraditionally grown epilayer structure of the GaN LEDs.6,106,144 A typi-\\ncal GaN epi structure is grown hetero-epitaxially on a sapphire sub-\\nstrate due to the lack of availability of a suitable substrate for\\nhomoepitaxial growth.145,146 The photons generated inside the GaN\\nFIG. 9.

This consequently reduces the\\noverall efﬁciency of the extracted light.147 Research', 'ers have suggested\\nmethods including chip shaping, photonic crystals, surface roughness,\\nand mesa shape modiﬁcation to improve the extraction efﬁciency of\\nmicroLEDs.148–152 This section discusses the techniques for extraction\\nefﬁciency enhancement in the context of various non-display\\napplications.\\n1. Photonic crystals\\nPhotonic crystals (PhCs) are repeated dielectric structures of\\nlength scales similar to the wavelength of light.148,153,154 These crystals\\nhave the capability to modify spontaneou', 's light emission by creating a\\nphotonic bandgap that can interact with the electronic bandgap of the\\nemission material.155 The photonic bandgap can be utilized in two\\nways to increase the extraction efﬁciency: inhibiting the emission of\\nthe guided modes or redirecting trapped light into radiated modes.\\nThe photonic crystals should be physically very close to the active light\\nemitting region to maximize their impact. Wierer et al. demonstrated\\nelectrically operated InGaN/GaN LEDs with photonic cr', 'ystals having\\na tunnel junction to provide lateral current spreading to the photonics\\ncrystals.154 This work reports increased microLED radiance and an\\napproximately 1.5x total increase in light extraction with photonic\\ncrystals incorporation. Additionally, the far-ﬁeld radiation pattern of\\nLEDs with PhC was also radically different than planar LEDs.154\\nOder et al. demonstrated extraction efﬁciency enhancement of\\n63% in InGaN/GaN blue (460 nm) microLEDs and 95% in AlInGaN/\\nGaN UV (340 nm) microL', 'EDs. These results were achieved by pat-\\nterning triangular arrays of photonic crystals with electron beam\\nlithography.156 Meanwhile, Kim et al. reported GaN LEDs with\\nsquare-lattice 2D photonics crystals patterned using laser holography\\n(LH) method suitable for high-throughput and large area process-\\ning.157 Figure 10(a) shows the photonic crystals and the schematic dia-\\ngram of the fabricated device. Enhancement in the light output of up\\nto 2.6\\x02 is observed in the device integrated with photon', 'ic crystals of\\nlattice constant 500 nm, as seen in Fig. 10(b). In other works, research-\\ners have fabricated photonic crystals on pGaN using monomer-based\\nnanoimprint lithography. These LEDs showed a 2.6\\x02 times increase\\nin photoluminescent intensity compared to LEDs without the pho-\\ntonic crystal patterns.158\\nMcGroddy et al. reported increased directional emission by 3.5\\x02\\nusing optimized 2D photonic crystals.159 These devices have additional\\nindex guiding layers in the vertical direction that ta', 'ke advantage of\\ndirectionality and guided mode control.159 Photonics crystal-based\\nLEDs rivaling the best of the non-photonic-crystal LEDs have also\\nbeen shown along with the theoretical electromagnetic calculations\\nmatching the measured results.148 Photonic crystals fabricated on the\\ntop of the surface of LEDs suffers from limited interaction with lower\\norder modes resulting in a poor extraction of a relatively high portion\\nof light carried by low order modes.160,161 Matioli et al. proposed\\nemb', 'edded air-gap PhCs within the LEDs for much greater interaction\\nwith low order modes to improve extraction efﬁciency further.153\\nImprovements as much as 8.3\\x02 has been shown using complex pho-\\ntonic structures through simulations in the recent past.149\\n2. Surface roughness\\nTextured, rough surfaces increase the extraction efﬁciency of\\nmicroLEDs by increasing the angular randomness of the photons\\ninside the light emitting diode. This randomization provides multiple\\nopportunities for the photons to ', 'enter the escape cone.162 Various\\nresearch groups have reported on increasing light extraction efﬁciency\\nusing surface roughness.162–171 Schnitzer et al. demonstrated an EQE\\nof 30% using a textured surface and a rear metallic reﬂector to enhance\\nangular randomization.162 Windisch et al. experimentally investigated\\nthe transmission properties of a textured surface to achieve 2\\x02\\nincrease in angle-average transmission and used it to achieve 46%\\nexternal extraction efﬁciency in unencapsulated light ', 'emitting\\ndiodes.163 Other methods created textured surfaces with natural\\nFIG. 10.

While it is\\neasier to roughen the pGaN surface at the top, Fuji et al. were able to\\nuse ﬂip-chip bonding and laser liftoff (LLO) to access the nGaN sur-\\nface for roughening.

Patterned Sapphire Substrate (PSS)\\nLight emitting diodes grown on commonly used c-plane sapphire\\nsubstrates suffer from high defect density in epilayers due to a large\\nmismatch between the lattice constant and thermal expansion coefﬁ-\\ncients of sapphire and GaN.144 These differences are responsible for\\ndegrading external quantum efﬁciency.144 Pat', 'terned sapphire sub-\\nstrates (PSS) featuring different types of artiﬁcial structures have\\nachieved notable progress toward solving these problems.140,173–175\\nThe microscale structures are generally created using conventional dry\\netching or wet etching methods; and nanoscale structures are fabri-\\ncated using nanospheres, nanoimprint lithography, or anodic alumi-\\nnum oxide techniques.176–180 PSS have several advantages over ﬂat\\nsapphire substrates. PSS provides a versatile platform for the growth ', 'of\\nvisible and UV epilayer structures, requires no interruption during the\\ngrowth process, reduces the density of threading dislocation in epi-\\nlayers, and enhances light extraction efﬁciency due to the increased\\nprobability of light scattering.181 PSS has also been shown to suppress\\nthe quantum conﬁned stark effect (QCSE) and improve UV-LED\\nexternal efﬁciency.182–184 Figure 12 shows a UV-LED with PSS incor-\\nporated.182 As seen in the comparison plot, UV-LED with PSS has a\\nhigher output power th', 'an a conventional LED at the same injected\\ncurrent. The origin of the improved light output power is attributed to\\nthe reduction in threading dislocation (TD) induced non-radiative\\nrecombination as well as enhanced light extraction due to scattering.\\nIncreased light output power with pyramidal patterns at both micro-\\nand nanoscale has been reported.185 Nanoscale patterns show more\\nimprovement in output power than microscale patterns.

In addition to modifying\\nthe lattice constant of the material, adding quantum dots (QD) or\\nphosphors to the mesa surface of microLEDs could enable a single-\\ncolored pixel to emit multiple colors.207,208 All three methods to', '\\nachieve different wavelength emissions are discussed in this section.\\nOther techniques such as quantum well (QW) thickness-dependent\\nInGaN/GaN multiple quantum wells (MQW), microfacet emission\\nfrom MQW, nanowires, and local strain engineering have also been\\nexplored in the literature for wavelength tuning in microLEDs.209–213\\n1. Colloidal Quantum Dots (QDs)\\nQDs are nanoscale semiconductor crystals with distinct proper-\\nties from those of bulk semiconductors.214,215 Each QD consists of a\\nsmall i', 'norganic semiconductor core (1–10 nm), a wider-bandgap\\nsemiconductor shell, and a coating of passivating ligands.216,217 An\\natomic force microscopy (AFM) height image of a closely packed\\nmonolayer of QDs is shown in Fig. 15(c). One of the most useful prop-\\nerties of these nanocrystals is the tunability of their bandgap by varying\\ntheir size and discrete energy levels also called the quantum conﬁned\\neffect.215,218 Figure 15(a) shows QD solutions of various sizes and\\ncomposition exhibiting photolu', 'minescence under UV light. Figure\\n15(b) shows the PL spectra of QDs with narrowband emission from\\nvisible to NIR. Several advantageous properties of QDs such as narrow\\nemission linewidth (20–30 nm for CdSe), high photoluminescence\\nquantum yield (PLQY > 90%), high photostability, and solution\\nprocessability\\nmake\\nthem\\nattractive\\nfor\\napplications\\nwith\\nmicroLEDs.126,219 CdSe, with an emission linewidth of 20–30 nm, and\\nPbS are the most commonly used materials for the core of the QDs for\\nvisible wave', 'length and NIR devices, respectively.214,220,221\\nAs mentioned in the application section, microLEDs are used in\\nVLC systems to achieve higher bandwidth and data transfer speeds.\\nThis has motivated the adoption of white light microLEDs with larger\\npixel sizes of 100 lm into VLC systems to achieve higher data transfer\\nrates without complicated signal processing.120 As a result, it has\\nbecome essential to ﬁnd a white light source with wavelength multi-\\nplexing ability for VLC systems. Recently, res', 'earchers have explored\\nQD-based white light microLEDs for VLC applications. Mei et al.\\ndemonstrated a white light system that used Perovskite QDs for a high\\nbandwidth VLC system.124 They showed 80 \\x02 80 lm2 microLEDs\\nhaving a modulation bandwidth of 160 MHz and a peak emission\\nwavelength of approximately 445 nm. They achieve bandwidths of up\\nto 85 MHz without ﬁlters or equalization in the white-light system.\\nThe system showed a maximum data transfer rate of 300 Mbps using a\\nnon-return-to-zero on-', 'off keying (NRZ-OOK) modulation scheme.\\nQD-based microLED arrays for bi-directional optogenetics applications\\nhave also been reported.222 They used QDs to create a dual-colored\\nmicroLED array with emissions at 462 and 623nm. This further\\nelucidates the use of QDs in non-display application technologies.\\n2. Phosphor\\nPhosphors are color-converting materials that are essential for\\nachieving full color and are a key component of white lighting sys-\\ntems.5,223,224 Generally, phosphors consist of two ', 'functional materials,\\na host material, and an activator material.225 Host materials are often\\nwide bandgap oxides, nitrides, or sulﬁdes and determine the crystal\\nstructure of the phosphor.226–228 Activator materials are usually transi-\\ntion metals or rare earth compounds and are responsible for light\\nemission.225 Both materials play critical roles in determining a phos-\\nphor’s photoluminescent properties, such as emission wavelength and\\nquantum efﬁciency. Figure 16(a) shows the crystal structure', ' of a nar-\\nrowband red-emitting phosphor material Sr4[LiAl11N14]:Eu2þ as an\\nexample.229\\nTraditionally, phosphors have been a preferred choice as a down-\\nconversion material for UV-LEDs and blue LEDs to obtain white light\\nsources, due to their high efﬁciency, high stability, and narrow spec-\\ntrum.125,229,230 However, phosphors’ larger size can cause signiﬁcant\\nnon-uniformity in the color conversion when used with small (50 lm)\\nmicroLEDs. The size of the phosphor can be varied depending upon\\nthe p', 'reparation process and nano-sized phosphors can be prepared.231\\nHowever, the luminous efﬁciency of the phosphor is proportional to\\nits size, and as a result, nano-sized phosphors have lower luminous\\nefﬁciencies.232\\nFIG. 15.

Chun et al. presented a high-speed VLC\\nsystem with a transmission rate of 1.68 Gbps at a distance of 3 cm\\nusing white light generated by blue GaN microLEDs and a yellow ﬂuo-\\nrescent converter.123 The high transmission speed is attributed to th', 'e\\nhigh modulation bandwidth of the polymer-based yellow ﬂuorescent\\nlayer. Huang et al. reported a white light VLC system with a 3-dB\\nmodulation bandwidth of 127.3 MHz using blue microLEDs and yel-\\nlow phosphor.122 Recently, Chang et al. reported a white light VLC\\nsystem that used semi-polar blue microLEDs and yellow phosphors to\\nachieve a data rate of 2.805 Gbps.128 The higher data rate and band-\\nwidth of the system are attributed to the improved radiative efﬁciency\\nof the semi-polar blue microL', 'EDs resulting from the reduced\\nquantum-conﬁned Stark effect (QCSE).\\nA hybrid strategy of mixing small-sized and large-sized phos-\\nphors can improve the non-uniformity of the system to a great extent\\nwith only a small reduction in efﬁciency. However, this remains a chal-\\nlenge as mesa dimensions shrink to smaller areas of 5 l m and\\nbelow.204 Recently, GE has developed a sub-micron sized red phos-\\nphor K2SiF6:Mn4þ (KSF) and KSF inks suitable for microLEDs that\\ncan be deposited by low-cost methods ', 'such as ink-jet printing, slot die\\ncoating, or spin coating.233 These recent developments pave the way\\nfor phosphors to be further utilized in microLED applications by over-\\ncoming challenges due to their size.\\n3.

The activation or suppression of different\\ncells expressed by different proteins is highly desirable for more\\nprecise control over the neuronal activity. Red-and-blue-colored\\nmicroLED-based optoelectronic probes have been used to demonstrate\\nbi-directional neuronal activity manipulation.251,252 Dual-colored\\nmicroLED arrays hav', 'e also been used as VLC transmitters and dem-\\nonstrated error-free data rates of 1.79–3.35 Gbps in a dual-wavelength\\nmultiplexing scheme.253 Further work is needed to enhance the efﬁ-\\nciency of longer wavelength microLEDs as longer wavelengths enable\\ndeeper neural cell stimulation in optogenetics and wavelength division\\nmultiplexing in VLC systems.254,255\\nV. OUTLOOK AND CHALLENGES\\nAs discussed in the article, MicroLED/LED technology has been\\nincorporated into a range of applications beyond displ', 'ay applications.\\nMicroLEDs based on InGaN/GaN have consistently higher efﬁciencies\\nthan competing approaches even as we scale down the device dimen-\\nsions to sub-micron size for blue, green, and red emissions. The efﬁ-\\nciency of the red-colored InGaN/GaN microLEDs can stand further\\nimprovement, especially at smaller dimensions. The ability to achieve\\nRGB emission from a single material stack will open a wide array of\\napplications\\nwith\\nincreasingly\\ncomplex\\nsystem\\nintegration.\\nAdditionally, the re', 'latively high cost of GaN epi wafers remains a chal-\\nlenge to be addressed, as microLED technology is adopted into a\\ngreater number of applications such as point-of-care medical applica-\\ntions like phototherapy and skin treatments.256,257\\nThe adoption of microLEDs in visible light communication\\n(VLC) systems has rapidly grown with improved data transfer rates.\\nAn increase in the modulation bandwidth is the driving factor for the\\nhigher data transfer rates. Device miniaturization and the decrease', ' in\\ncarrier lifetime of microLEDs can further improve this trend.\\nAdditionally, VLC systems that use an array of microLEDs as emitters\\nhave the potential to enhance the data transfer rates even higher, albeit\\nwith the increased system complexity. Implementation of VLC in lab-\\noratory setup is routinely demonstrated, but the real-life system still\\nremains a challenge. Many critical issues such as reliability, scalability,\\nand compactness related to the commercialization of the VLC systems\\nremain ', 'to be addressed.\\nAs optogenetics advances our understanding of neural circuits,\\nmicroLEDs will have an increasingly prevalent role in delivering spa-\\ntially resolved single-neuron stimulation. This would require scaling\\ndown microLEDs further along and improving external efﬁciency to\\nbe able to deliver enough light irradiation to create action potentials.\\nThe mesa size-related efﬁciency droop needs to be further improved.\\nClosed loop stimulation and monitoring of a large ensemble of neu-\\nrons wo', 'uld require large-scale device fabrication. Integration with\\nmicroLED drivers and electrode arrays also needs to be addressed. As\\nmicroLEDs are scaled down to the nanoscale, they will have the\\npotential for an entirely new concept of microscopy, NIM with resolu-\\ntion capabilities surpassing the diffraction limit. However, as the\\nmicroLEDs are miniaturized to nanoscale dimensions, increased non-\\nradiative recombination due to the larger surface-to-volume ratio of\\nthe mesa becomes a challenge.15,1', '6 Various mesa sidewall passivation\\nmethods, such as dielectric (e.g., SiO2, Al2O3) deposition using\\nplasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) and atomic\\nlayer deposition (ALD), acid-base etching, hydrogen plasma, and sul-\\nfur treatments, are suggested ways to minimize non-radiative recombi-\\nnation and improve the external quantum efﬁciency.258–261\\nProgress toward improving the extraction efﬁciency of LEDs\\nusing photonic crystals and beam shaping using microlenses has been\\nmade, but chal', 'lenges related to reliable integration with microLEDs\\nremain to be addressed. The most common microlens fabrication\\ntechnique (as the reﬂow method) faces uniformity and control chal-\\nlenges that need to be improved. The fabrication of high-quality opti-\\ncal microlenses to minimize scattering is also a challenge. Photonic\\ncrystal fabrication often requires using electron beam lithography\\nwhich is expensive and offers a low throughput. Simpler and more\\nreliable fabrication techniques need to be de', 'veloped for further inte-\\ngration with microLEDs and to enable more widespread utilization of\\nthese advanced methods.\\nThe ability to modify the electro-optical properties of microLEDs\\nusing various techniques has the potential to enable even more appli-\\ncations beyond displays. MicroLEDs can be used further as active ele-\\nments in chemical sensors for environmental monitoring and optically\\nactivating gas sensors to enable room temperature gas sensing.262–264\\nThe potential of microLEDs as a light', ' source for various computa-\\ntional microscopy techniques further remains to be explored. More\\nresearch into eliminating size-scaling related efﬁciency droop as well\\nas compatibility and integration with silicon processing needs to be\\nundertaken to further reduce cost and improve integration.

display devices is expected to\\nenable much brighter, broader color gamut, longer lifetime, and\\nextremely high pixels per inch (PPI) displays', 'A number of these char-\\nacteristics are especially highly desirable in displays for augmented\\nreality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications', 'There are multiple\\nnext-generation display demonstrations in the commercial sector.\\nSamsung demonstrated a microLED display of 292 inches at CES\\n2020.12 Jade Bird has demonstrated a microdisplay of 0.3 in', 'with 5000\\nPPI for AR/VR applications.13 Recently, Compound Photonics\\nunveiled a microdisplay with a record resolution of 8424 PPI.14 The\\nwide interest from the commercial sector to push for the next genera-\\ntion of display technologies using microLEDs has propelled the\\nresearch effort into improving the key microLED characteristics such\\nas efﬁciency, brightness, full-color emission, and lifetime.\\nWhile microLEDs have been receiving signiﬁcant commercial\\ninterest for their use as emitters for display technology, little commer-\\ncial focus has been applied to microLEDs for non-display applications,\\nwhich is an active area of research (see Fig', '1)', 'While high information\\ncontent displays require a high resolution and small pixels, which can\\nlead to challenges including reduced efﬁciency due to greater non-\\nradiative recombination, higher current density, and degraded extrac-\\ntion,15–18 many of the reviewed non-display applications can beneﬁt\\nfrom single pixel control and take advantage of relatively efﬁcient,\\nlarger pixels', 'Future applications, especially in areas that beneﬁt from\\nultra-small (e.g., sub micrometer) LEDs, experience some of these\\nchallenges and are brieﬂy also discussed', 'MicroLEDs are increasingly\\nbeing used as a signal emitter in visible light communication (VLC)\\nsystems due to their high modulation bandwidth and ability to offer\\nparallel channels for communication using microLED array.19–21\\nMicroLEDs are also well-suited for optogenetic stimulation, requiring\\na spatially resolved high-intensity light source.22–24 Multiple computa-\\ntional microscopy techniques, such as structured illumination micros-\\ncopy (SIM), for neural imaging have also used microLEDs as light\\nsources.25,26 The high intensity emission in the UV-blue spectrum also\\nmakes microLEDs suitable for maskless lithography.27 These non-\\ndisplay applications often require modiﬁcation in the electro-optical\\ncharacteristics of microLEDs', 'Performance

extraordinary combination of high luminance, high energy efﬁciency, low cost, and long lifetime These characteristics are highly desirable in various applications, but their usage has, to date, been primarily focused toward next-generation display technologies Applications of microLEDs in other technologies, such as projector systems, computational imaging, communication systems, or neural stim- ulation, have been limited In non-display applications which use microLEDs as light sources, modiﬁcations in key electrical and optical char- acteristics such as external efﬁciency, output beam shape, modulation bandwidth, light output power, and emission wavelengths are often needed for optimum performance A number of advanced fabrication and processing techniques have been used to achieve these electro- optical characteristics in microLEDs In this article, we review the non-display application areas of the microLEDs, the distinct opto- electrical characteristics required for these

      16 I INTRODUCTION The light emitting diodes (LEDs) based on InGaN/GaN semicon- ductors have become ubiquitous These devices are an integral part of the solid-state lighting ecosystem including automobiles, smartphones, home lighting systems, and industrial lighting.1–5 The adoption of LEDs has enabled additional functionalities in the form of longer life- time, more reliable operation, smaller form factor, and lower power consumption in almost every application Much of the effort toward cost reduction in LEDs has been focused on increasing external efﬁciency using improved material growth techniques and optimizing fabrication processes.6 The reduc- tion in high costs of GaN semiconductor-based light emitting diodes is a challenge that needs to be addressed', 'Recent progress toward Appl Phys Rev 10, 021306 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0125103 10, 021306-1 Published under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing Applied Physics Reviews REVIEW scitation.org/journal/are  07 June 2024 12:27:45 obtaining high-efﬁciency red, green, and blue LEDs using InGaN/GaN semiconductors is further paving way for new applications.7–9 One of the most widely anticipated applications of microLEDs and RGB capability is in next-generation self-emissive display technol- ogy.10,11 The adoption of microLEDs in display devices is expected to enable much brighter, broader color gamut, longer lifetime, and extremely high pixels per inch (PPI) displays A number of these char- acteristics are especially highly desirable in displays for augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications There are multiple next-generation display demonstrations in the commercial sector Samsung demonstrated a microLED display of 292 inches at CES 2020.12 Jade Bird has demonstrated a microdisplay of 0.3 in with 5000 PPI for AR/VR applications.13 Recently, Compound Photonics unveiled a microdisplay with a record resolution of 8424 PPI.14 The wide interest from the commercial sector to push for the next genera- tion of display technologies using microLEDs has propelled the research effort into improving the key microLED characteristics such as efﬁciency, brightness, full-color emission, and lifetime While microLEDs have been receiving signiﬁcant commercial interest for their use as emitters for display technology, little commer- cial focus has been applied to microLEDs for non-display applications, which is an active area of research (see Fig 1) While high information content displays require a high resolution and small pixels, which can lead to challenges including reduced efﬁciency due to greater non- radiative recombination, higher current density, and degraded extrac- tion,15–18 many of the reviewed non-display applications can beneﬁt from single pixel control and take advantage of relatively efﬁcient, larger pixels Future applications, especially in areas that beneﬁt from ultra-small (e.g., sub micrometer) LEDs, experience some of these challenges and are brieﬂy also discussed MicroLEDs are increasingly being used as a signal emitter in visible light communication (VLC) systems due to their high modulation bandwidth and ability to offer parallel channels for communication using microLED array.19–21 MicroLEDs are also well-suited for optogenetic stimulation, requiring a spatially resolved high-intensity light source.22–24 Multiple computa- tional microscopy techniques, such as structured illumination micros- copy (SIM), for neural imaging have also used microLEDs as light sources.25,26 The high intensity emission in the UV-blue spectrum also makes microLEDs suitable for maskless lithography.27 These non- display applications often require modiﬁcation in the electro-optical characteristics of microLEDs Performance characteristics such as modulation bandwidth, light output power, emission wavelength, and extraction efﬁciency are tailored by integrating additional optical and electrical structures (see Fig 1) The fabrication of the optical struc- tures requires more processing on the top of the microLED structure Despite the progress in fabrication capabilities, a number of challenges remain to be addressed for these applications In this review, we explore microLED electro-optical characteris- tics needed for non-display applications We ﬁrst discuss multiple non-display application areas highlighting key past results and ongo- ing research work We then examine the performance metrics critical for the non-display applications', 'Deﬁnitions of the key metrics from a non-display application point of view are presented We also highlight optical structures such as photonic crystals, microlens, quantum dots, FIG 1 A schematic diagram illustrating the correlation of key non-display applications

microLEDs Finally, the outlook and challenges associated with the integration of advanced structures with microLEDs and their broader applications are discussed The schematic diagram encom- passing the review is shown in Fig 1 II NON-DISPLAY APPLICATION AREAS MicroLEDs have been extensively explored as pixels for next- generation displays with ultra-high brightness, deeper color gamut, and longer lifetime.28–31 The high luminance, energy efﬁciency, reli- ability, low cost, and bio-compatibility of microLEDs also enable them to be used in various non-display technologies such as visible light communications (VLC), photolithography, optogenetics stimulation, light sources for structured illumination microscopy (SIM), and super- resolution imaging.22,25–27,32,33 This section focuses on the system setup and recent progress of each of these applications A Visible Light Communication (VLC) The usage of microLEDs in visible light communication (VLC) systems has been investigated both as emitter devices and as photode- tectors (PD).19–21,34 The VLC system, shown in Fig 2(c), consists of three primary components: an optical transmitter, an optical channel, and a receiver.35 The optical transmitter contains the waveform gener- ator, encoders, driver electronics, microLED emitters, and transmitter optics The optical channel allows for data transfer through air or another desired medium The receiver contains receiver optics, photo- detectors, ampliﬁers, and decoders The schematic diagram of a mea- surement setup for frequency response characterization having similar components is also shown in Fig 2(a) The lower RC values of microLEDs arising from their small size (1–100 lm) and short carrier lifetime result in a high modulation bandwidth A higher 3-dB modulation bandwidth allows a higher data rate transfer in the communication system These characteristics make microLEDs an attractive choice for optical data emitters in high-speed FIG 2 The schematic diagram of a visible light communication (VLC) system (a) The system setup to measure the frequency response of microLEDs The system consists of a vector network analyzer, a bias-tee for operating the microLED, a plastic ﬁber for coupling the light, and a photodetector (b) A plot showing improved frequency response with increasing injected current density The current is increased from 5 to 40 mA A maximum 3-dB modulation bandwidth of 756 MHz is shown in the inset at 2000 A/cm2 (c) The system setup for VLC communication data-rate characterization consists of the signal quality analyzer, 20 dB ampliﬁer, bias-tee, photodetector, and a digital oscilloscope', '(d) Eye-diagram demonstrating data rates up to 1.5 Gbps with relatively higher SNR Reprinted with permission from Chen et al., ACS Photonics 7,

ation, which was shown by McKenry et al to improve high modulation bandwidth capabilities.37 One example where an opera- tion at higher current density (at 2 kA/cm2) leads to a record improve- ment in 3-dB modulation bandwidth (756 MHz) is shown in Fig 2(b) Additionally, 3-dB bandwidth is proportional to the increasing current density as seen in the inset of Fig 2(b) Data rates for VLC systems have increased from 1 Gbps to as high as 11.7 Gbps in recent works Mckendry et al demonstrated a data transfer speed of 1 Gbps in 2010 using an individually addressable 16 \\x02 16 microLED array with 72 l m diameter pixel size.19 The blue emitter of wavelength 450 nm showed a 3-dB modulation bandwidth of 245 MHz In 2020, Xie et al demonstrated a record data transfer rate of 11.7 Gbps using a series-biased blue 3 \\x02 3 microLED array.38 This array featured smaller 20 lm diameter elements, generated over 10 mW of optical power, and displayed a high 3-dB modulation band- width of 980 MHz Many modulation schemes can be used to encode the data in the VLC systems Most microLED VLC systems report implementing one of three key modulation schemes: Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM), On-Off Key (OOK), or Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) The selection of one method depends on the prioritization of complexity or efﬁciency requirements A detailed dis- cussion of modulation schemes in VLC systems can be found in the comprehensive text by Nan Chi (2018).39 The use of pixels with increasingly small diameters (tens of micrometers) to achieve improved data transfer rates of more than 10 Gbps in VLC systems is an encouraging sign that next-generation communication systems could be successfully implemented using microLED technology B Optogenetic stimulation Optogenetics, the technique by which light is used to selectively stimulate neural cells, has revolutionized the ﬁeld of neuroscience.40–47 It is a most widely used method to study the causal relationship between neural circuits and behavior.46 Researchers have explored using various light transmission methods, including ﬁber optic cables and waveguides, to deliver stimuli to speciﬁc neuron cell popula- tions.48–51 These approaches can stimulate a large number of neural cells, but struggle to deliver light at a high spatial resolution, a key requirement for decoding neural circuits Grossman et al proposed a simple solution to this problem by creating an array of microLEDs capable of generating arbitrary optical excitation patterns on neuronal samples with high resolution.52 This concept of matrix photostimula- tion is illustrated in Fig 3(a) A light-sensitive ion channel known as channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) provides a powerful tool for millisecond neural excitation.40 ChR2 expressing neural cells are covered with microLEDs that each has individual control over their illumination intensity and timing for optical excitation', 'To gain a fuller understanding of the causal relationship between neuronal circuits and their behavior, simultaneous localized stimula- tion and electrical recording of neural cells are required Such an experimental setup then must address the additional challenge of directly integrating light sources onto the stimulation sites Scalable designs that monolithically integrate microLEDs and recording sites onto silicon neural probes can solve this problem to enable closed- loop light stimulation and electrical recordings.53–55 Figure 3(b) shows the 48 microLED probe used by Wu et al to independently stimulate distinct cells spaced 50 l m apart.53 Neural recordings from a freely moving mouse using this probe are also shown Scharf et al used a similar approach but increased their system’s scalability by integrating FIG 3 (a) A 64 \\x02

at 5 mA current McAlinden et al further scaled the optrode array by creating a device with the capability to deliver light stimuli at 181 sites This milestone was achieved by a novel fabrication method for microLEDs on GaN-on-Sapphire with glass microneedle.56 Tethered neural stimulation restricts the free movement of rodents To enable untethered, remote-controlled neural stimulation and electrochemical sensing of freely moving mice, Liu et al developed wireless, implantable probes with microLEDs for optogenetic stimula- tion and dopamine detection.57 While these devices provide a high pre- cision spatiotemporal stimulation method, they can cause undesirable stimulation artifacts with high enough amplitudes to mask neuronal activities.53 Kim et al demonstrated opto-electrodes capable of eliminat- ing electromagnetic interference (EMI) induced and photovoltaic (PV) related stimulation artifacts using multi-layer metal structures and heavily boron-doped silicon substrates, respectively.58 The application of microLEDs in optogenetic stimulation is paving the way for studies of freely moving rodents’ neuronal circuits by providing compact optro- des that are essential for decoding the neural basis of behavior C Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM) Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) allows optical section- ing imaging (OS-SIM) and/or super-resolution imaging (SR-SIM) of neural cells by modifying conventional microscopes.59–63 It has become a widely utilized method', 'Its widespread use can be attributed to its relatively simple setup, which enables wideﬁeld imaging and inte- gration with traditional microscopes Structured illumination micros- copy (SIM) uses the principle that higher spatial frequencies attenuate faster with defocus than lower spatial frequencies For an illuminated sample with a grid projection, the modulation in the out-of-focus part of the image attenuates faster than the thin in-focus part of the image The optically sectioned part of the image can be extracted by looking at the modulation part in the image Figure 4(a) demonstrates how the optically sectioned part of the image can be extracted from the modu- lated image section The grid moves into three equally spaced posi- tions, sequentially capturing thirds of the image and then combining them to obtain an optically sectioned or a super-resolved image.25 Traditionally, this has been achieved by placing a grating grid in the illumination path and then using a piezo-based system to mechan- ically move the pattern and obtain phase-shifting.64,65 The mechanical movement limits the speed and accuracy of the system Digital micro- mirror device (DMD) based programmable spatial light modulators (SLMs) have been used to replace the gratings and get around the aforementioned limitations caused by slow mechanical move- ment.26,66–68 These systems use lamp or LED based illumination However, controlling illumination patterns using DMD increases the complexity of the system due to the added optical elements and increased optical path They also suffer from the blazed grating effect that causes SIM patterns with varying intensity distribution.69,70 The resulting SIM patterns are prone to reconstruction artifacts Using electrically programmable microLED arrays for patterned illumination is an efﬁcient, low-cost solution with no moving parts in a system MicroLED based structural illumination also provides additional bin- ning capabilities for the illumination pattern Figure 4(b) shows a microscope setup developed by Poher et al for optical sectioning using a microLED strip array as a light source.25 The ability to use the same microscope for the implementation of multiple imaging methods demonstrate a clear advantage of optical designs that use microLED array as a pattern illumination source In addition, microLED-based light source systems could be miniaturized sufﬁciently to be used in miniscope designs for the neural imaging of freely moving mice which is essential for understanding the brain circuitry A more detailed review of the SIM technique can be found in the cited articles.71–73 D Other imaging techniques Light emitting diode (LED) arrays have been used as a light source in a new type of microscope called an LED array microscope to FIG 4 (a) Concept illustration of SIM technique In conventional microscopy,

traditional microscope with a programmable LED array This method of computational imaging allows label-free multi-contrast, i.e., bright- ﬁeld, darkﬁeld, phase contrast, and Fourier ptychography imaging to be combined on a single platform Brightﬁeld contrast imaging is used to image samples with strong absorption, darkﬁeld contrast is better suited for sub-resolution features, and phase contrast is primarily uti- lized for a transparent sample.78 As different contrast modes provide different information about a sample, it is desirable to have all the imaging modes on a single hardware platform In traditional microscopy methods, different imaging techniques require hardware changes in the microscopy setup, while LED array microscopy provides a way to obtain different imaging modalities using a post-processing imaging algorithm without any change in the hardware Figure 5(a) shows a time-multiplexing scheme implemented using LED arrays to obtain multi-contrast imaging Even though these methods only require the modiﬁcation of conventional microscopes to achieve different imaging techniques, optical components such as lenses and objectives make it bulky and expensive For this reason, lens-free microscopy systems utilizing LEDs as light sources have become widely popular alternatives.80–84 This system consists of a known and a partially coherent light source for sample illumination and an image sensor for collecting the shadow image, which is then used to reconstruct the full image Removing the objective lens from the optical path provides a way to decouple the ﬁeld of view (FOV) and resolution In decoupled lens-free systems, the resolution is lim- ited by the pixel size, and the FOV is determined by the active area of the image sensor The current resolution is limited to around 1 lm.85 This limitation can be mitigated by using techniques such as pixel super-resolution at the expense of a more complex setup.82 The spatial resolution of the traditional optical systems is limited due to the laws of diffraction inherent to all optical systems.86,87 This limit is about 200 nm due to Abbe diffraction.88,89 Various super- resolution (SR) techniques, such as photoactivated localization micros- copy (PALM), stimulated emission depletion microscopy (STED), and stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), have been explored to mitigate this fundamental limit.74 Another approach to pushing past this limit using LEDs is emerg- ing as the size of the microLEDs decreases toward nanoLEDs.90–92 The sub-micron dimensions of nanoLEDs allow them to serve as spatially resolved light sources and pave the way for Nano Illumination Microscopy (NIM).93,94 In this technique, spatially resolved light sour- ces are used to scan a sample by sequentially illuminating the nanoLED array and recording the optical signal through the sample on highly sensitive image sensors', 'Figure 5(b) shows how a sample can be imaged by measuring the intensity of light reaching an array of image sensors from each individual light source after passing through the sample In this case, the resolution of the system is limited by the pitch of the illu- mination source rather than the detection system NanoLED arrays with pitches as small as 70nm have been demonstrated which can lead to a resolution of approximately 140nm which is much improved than the lens-free approach with resolution limited to around 1l m.85,92 With the absence of bulky lens systems, nanoLED methods could dra- matically improve the form factor of super-resolution microscopy and enable a new array of applications in biological imaging E Maskless photolithography Matrix addressable microLED and LED array emitters are highly desirable as light sources for photolithography due to their ability to generate and transfer patterns on photosensitive materials without the FIG 5 (a) A time-multiplexing scheme for multi-contrast imaging in real time using LED

have demonstrated the capability of microLEDs for maskless lithography.27,33,95,96 Jeon et al performed mask-free photolithography using a 64 \\x02 64 UV microLED emitter array integrated with microlenses for light collimation.33 Two circular disks with 30 and 16 lm diameters were patterned using an i-line pho- toresist to demonstrate the proof of concept of the integrated device Guijt et al built a simpler and cost-effective photolithographic setup with off-the-shelf UV LEDs, hardware, and optical components.97 The system collimated light with a pinhole and plastic tube, focused on the sample with standard a microscope objective, and moved the substrate into position with a motorized linear stage The results demonstrated direct writing lithography for rapid prototyping of features smaller than 20 lm.97 A similar approach utilizing off-the-shelf UV LEDs and a rotary stage was used by Suzuki et al for lithography of curved microstruc- tures.95 This work used the inherent Lambertian distribution property of the planar LED to achieve the difference in UV exposure dose required for high-aspect-ratio and curved surface structures such as microlenses and waveguides of hundreds of micrometers of thickness.95 Figure 6(a) shows how Elfstrom et al', 'further advanced the tech- nique by combining a CMOS-controlled microLED array with a projection system and translation stage to achieve written features as small as 8 lm.27 Building further on the same setup, Guilhabert et al reported mask-fee direct pattern writing with features as small as 500 nm by primarily modifying the projection optics.96 They also showed the fabrication of InGaN micro-LEDs using the same setup Recently, Wu et al reported a UV micro-LED display with full high- deﬁnition of 960 \\x02

All these reports show the potential of microLED technology for photolithography applications that require minimal setup and provide a budget-friendly alternative to traditional laser- based systems III PERFORMANCE METRICS FOR NON-DISPLAY APPLICATIONS The various applications discussed in Sec II have different pri- mary enabling performance properties Table I summarizes the reviewed non-display applications and the key desirable properties MicroLED technology offers superior performance than organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) for key properties such as brightness, response time, and lifetime Table II summarizes the performance comparison between the microLEDs and OLED technology.99 Many of the metrics, such as superior brightness, reliability, and lifetime, make microLEDs well-suited to both display and non-display, but some of the key performance metrics for non-display applications dif- fer from those for display applications This section discusses the key performance parameters of microLEDs that must be optimized or enhanced for non-display applications These metrics include optical extraction, angle of extraction, modulation bandwidth, light output

under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing  07 June 2024 12:27:45 A Optical extraction efficiency—EQE vs IQE Blue microLEDs have internal quantum efﬁciencies (IQEs) that can exceed ninety percent as a result of advances in growth techniques that have yielded high-quality materials and crystal structures.100–103 However, the external quantum efﬁciency (EQE) of GaN-based microLEDs, deﬁned as the ratio of the number of photons emitted vs the number of photons internally generated, is comparatively low with a peak EQE of generally smaller than 15%.104–106 The EQE of the microLEDs can be viewed as the product of two separate efﬁciencies: IQE and light extraction efﬁciency (LEE).107 While IQE is signiﬁcantly improved over the years, LEE has been a limiting factor.100,108,109 Low LEE is primarily due to the large refractive index difference between air and semiconductors that traps light from total internal reﬂection (TIR) and Fresnel loss at the interface.110 For example, the external efﬁciency could be as low as 4.3% in a typical semiconductor material with a refractive index of 2.4', 'Figure 7 graphically demonstrates how only the light inside the escape cone, deﬁned by the critical angle, is able to escape This limitation presents a challenge for microLEDs in applications such as optogenetic stimulation because the photosensi- tive opsins often require minimum irradiance (typically in the range of 10–100 mW/cm2 in instantaneous light intensity) to be delivered at the neurons for activation and ﬂuorescence.111,112 Achieving the desired optical power numbers with smaller microLEDs requires improvements in the external efﬁciency of the microLED A number of techniques to overcome the limitation of low EQE are discussed in Sec IVA B Angle of extraction One critical metric for non-display applications is the angle of the light emitted from the active region of the microLED source Planar microLEDs exhibit a Lambertian output distribution at the source by default, which is advantageous for wide-viewing applications such as displays.113,114 On the other hand, applications like structured illumination microscopy (SIM) require that the light extraction cone be as narrow as possible A lower numerical aperture (NA) is needed to prevent any light leakage into an adjacent pixel or row.62,63 A nar- rower light beam is also needed to better couple the light into the opti- cal systems and control the optical path.115 A wider extraction cone decreases coupled light into the optical system and, thus, the overall optical efﬁciency of the system Removing collimating optics, as seen in the system in Fig 8(a), is advantageous in decreasing the complexity and bulkiness of the system overall.116 Additionally, Sun et al also showed that the presence of photonic crystals can narrow the light FIG 7 A schematic diagram showing the concept of escape cone The escape cone at the semiconductor with refractive index ns and the air with refractive index nair interface is deﬁned by the critical angle Only the light inside the escape cone is eventually emitted from the active region of the microLED; everything else is reﬂected back into the semiconductor and reabsorbed, leading to a low extraction efﬁciency FIG 8 (a) The need for a collimator and relay lens to collect and collimate all the light from wide angle cone source

need for an additional lens system to col- lect and collimate light.116 In another work, Iyer et al showed unidi- rectional luminescence from InGaN/GaN quantum well metasurfaces at arbitrary engineered angles.117 Huang et al further developed this idea by proposing a single-chip microLED with unidirectional emis- sion that integrates the resonant cavity and metasurfaces for potential application to 3D displays.118 The usage of the resonant cavity and metasurfaces in situ provides an additional tuning parameter to gener- ate unidirectional emission with controllable full width at half maxi- mum (FWHM), achieving angles as narrow as 10\\x03, 20\\x03, and 30\\x03 as shown in Fig', '8(b) C Modulation bandwidth The bandwidth of a communication system is a key determining factor of its maximum achievable data transfer rate In this context, the 3-dB modulation bandwidth of microLEDs is the most important factor for visible light communication systems as an optical signal emitter The modulation bandwidth is determined by the carrier life- time of the emitter and the RC time constant, where R is the differen- tial resistance and C is the device capacitance.36,37 The lower RC values of microLEDs arising from their small size and short carrier lifetime result in a high modulation bandwidth that can easily reach several hundred MHz.37,119,120 A plot of modulation bandwidth against current density for various mesa dimensions is shown in Fig 9 The modulation bandwidth initially increases with the current density because carrier lifetime is the dominant factor determining the band- width At a higher current density, the RC time constant becomes a dominant factor limiting the current density.121,122 At the desired cur- rent density, either one of the dominant factors can be improved to increase the modulation bandwidth for the VLC system D Emission wavelength Tuning microLED light emission to a particular wavelength is highly desirable for many non-display applications.20,55,58,98,123 Apart from the need for red, green, and blue emissions for full-color microLEDs displays, it is also required for solid-state lighting and white light communication systems.124,125 There are three primary ways to modify light emission wavelength: through phosphors, using quantum dots (QDs), or by changing the compound semiconductor layer itself.126–129 These techniques are discussed in detail in Sec IVC The wavelength of the light emitted from the microLEDs is also an important factor for optogenetic stimulations The light-sensitive pro- teins, i.e., opsins, are sensitive only to a certain range of wavelengths It is important to match light emission to the maximally sensitive wave- length of these proteins.130 For example, channelrhodopsins (ChRs) absorption peaks range from 440 to 590 nm, and other retinal-binding proteins show peaks from 630 to 644 nm.131–136 Emission wavelength is similarly important for photolithographic applications because pho- toresist must be exposed at wavelengths in the UV region for proper development.137,138 E Light Output Power (LOP) The light output power of microLEDs is one the most important factors for applications including solid-state lighting, optogenetics, imaging, and photolithography.21,97,139,140 The light-output power of microLEDs initially increases as we increase injected current density but then saturates and further decreases as the current density is increased.139,141 This is due to the self-heating effect that causes increased non-radiative recombination and carrier leakage.141,142 As mentioned earlier, in optogenetics applications, there is a minimum light output power required at the neurons for the photosensitive pro- teins to stimulate action potentials.111,112 Even though microLEDs can operate at much higher current densities (>1 kA/cm2) than LEDs, the total light output power (LOP) is smaller due to their small size.143 If an optogenetic application requires deeper tissue stimulation, the opti- cal output power of microLEDs becomes even more important.134 Thicker photoresists used in photolithography also require higher light output power for adequate exposure.137 IV', 'OPTICAL STRUCTURES FOR IMPROVED PERFORMANCE Despite the superior performance of microLEDs when compared with OLEDs, modiﬁcation in the key properties of microLEDs is often required for non-display applications Electro-optical components such as photonic crystals, nanostructures, microlenses, Fresnel lenses, quantum dots, phosphors, etc., are integrated with the traditional microLEDs to improve the output performance Key optical compo- nents that can enhance the performance metrics of microLEDs and make them more suitable for use in non-display applications are dis- cussed in Secs IVA–V A Extraction efficiency enhancement The low extraction efﬁciency of microLEDs originates from the traditionally grown epilayer structure of the GaN LEDs.6,106,144 A typi- cal GaN epi structure is grown hetero-epitaxially on a sapphire sub- strate due to the lack of availability of a suitable substrate for homoepitaxial growth.145,146 The photons generated inside the GaN FIG 9 A graph showing the 3-dB modulation bandwidth of microLEDs as a func- tion of current density for different pixel sizes ranging from 60 to 160 lm The mod- ulation bandwidth initially

consequently reduces the overall efﬁciency of the extracted light.147 Researchers have suggested methods including chip shaping, photonic crystals, surface roughness, and mesa shape modiﬁcation to improve the extraction efﬁciency of microLEDs.148–152 This section discusses the techniques for extraction efﬁciency enhancement in the context of various non-display applications 1 Photonic crystals Photonic crystals (PhCs) are repeated dielectric structures of length scales similar to the wavelength of light.148,153,154 These crystals have the capability to modify spontaneous light emission by creating a photonic bandgap that can interact with the electronic bandgap of the emission material.155 The photonic bandgap can be utilized in two ways to increase the extraction efﬁciency: inhibiting the emission of the guided modes or redirecting trapped light into radiated modes The photonic crystals should be physically very close to the active light emitting region to maximize their impact Wierer et al demonstrated electrically operated InGaN/GaN LEDs with photonic crystals having a tunnel junction to provide lateral current spreading to the photonics crystals.154 This work reports increased microLED radiance and an approximately 1.5x total increase in light extraction with photonic crystals incorporation Additionally, the far-ﬁeld radiation pattern of LEDs with PhC was also radically different than planar LEDs.154 Oder et al demonstrated extraction efﬁciency enhancement of 63% in InGaN/GaN blue (460 nm) microLEDs and 95% in AlInGaN/ GaN UV (340 nm) microLEDs', 'These results were achieved by pat- terning triangular arrays of photonic crystals with electron beam lithography.156 Meanwhile, Kim et al reported GaN LEDs with square-lattice 2D photonics crystals patterned using laser holography (LH) method suitable for high-throughput and large area process- ing.157 Figure 10(a) shows the photonic crystals and the schematic dia- gram of the fabricated device Enhancement in the light output of up to 2.6\\x02 is observed in the device integrated with photonic crystals of lattice constant 500 nm, as seen in Fig 10(b) In other works, research- ers have fabricated photonic crystals on pGaN using monomer-based nanoimprint lithography These LEDs showed a 2.6\\x02 times increase in photoluminescent intensity compared to LEDs without the pho- tonic crystal patterns.158 McGroddy et al reported increased directional emission by 3.5\\x02 using optimized 2D photonic crystals.159 These devices have additional index guiding layers in the vertical direction that take advantage of directionality and guided mode control.159 Photonics crystal-based LEDs rivaling the best of the non-photonic-crystal LEDs have also been shown along with the theoretical electromagnetic calculations matching the measured results.148 Photonic crystals fabricated on the top of the surface of LEDs suffers from limited interaction with lower order modes resulting in a poor extraction of a relatively high portion of light carried by low order modes.160,161 Matioli et al proposed embedded air-gap PhCs within the LEDs for much greater interaction with low order modes to improve extraction efﬁciency further.153 Improvements as much as 8.3\\x02 has been shown using complex pho- tonic structures through simulations in the recent past.149 2 Surface roughness Textured, rough surfaces increase the extraction efﬁciency of microLEDs by increasing the angular randomness of the photons inside the light emitting diode This randomization provides multiple opportunities for the photons to enter the escape cone.162 Various research groups have reported on increasing light extraction efﬁciency using surface roughness.162–171 Schnitzer et al demonstrated an EQE of 30% using a textured surface and a rear metallic reﬂector to enhance angular randomization.162 Windisch et al experimentally investigated the transmission properties of a textured surface to achieve 2\\x02 increase in angle-average transmission and used it to achieve 46% external extraction efﬁciency in unencapsulated light emitting diodes.163 Other methods created textured surfaces with natural FIG 10 Photonic crystal integration with microLEDs (a) SEM image of air-hole photonic crystals patterned using holographic double exposure on the top of an LED structure

mask.171,172 Improved light output and electrical performance were also observed after microroughening the pGaN surface using metal clusters as etch masks during wet etching.164 A typical GaN LED structure consists of a thin pGaN layer on the top and a nGaN layer grown on a sapphire substrate While it is easier to roughen the pGaN surface at the top, Fuji et al were able to use ﬂip-chip bonding and laser liftoff (LLO) to access the nGaN sur- face for roughening They demonstrated a 2.3\\x02 improvement in the total output power compared to that of a non-roughened LED.165 Figure 11 shows the roughened nGaN surface and the resulting improvement in the performance of an LED with the increase in sur- face roughness.165 Double-sided roughening of both the pGaN layer and the undoped layer can increase the randomization of the photons and further improve light output.166 Chang et al went beyond the typ- ical etching process and used femtosecond laser ablation to create nanostructures on the surface to increase light output from LEDs by 18%.169 A recent computational study comparing the effectiveness of surface roughening with that of integrating photonic crystals shows that photonic crystals can create higher light extraction improvements, but the ease of fabrication to create surface roughness still makes it a compelling method to improve light extraction from light emitting diodes.170 3 Patterned Sapphire Substrate (PSS) Light emitting diodes grown on commonly used c-plane sapphire substrates suffer from high defect density in epilayers due to a large mismatch between the lattice constant and thermal expansion coefﬁ- cients of sapphire and GaN.144 These differences are responsible for degrading external quantum efﬁciency.144 Patterned sapphire sub- strates (PSS) featuring different types of artiﬁcial structures have achieved notable progress toward solving these problems.140,173–175 The microscale structures are generally created using conventional dry etching or wet etching methods; and nanoscale structures are fabri- cated using nanospheres, nanoimprint lithography, or anodic alumi- num oxide techniques.176–180 PSS have several advantages over ﬂat sapphire substrates PSS provides a versatile platform for the growth of visible and UV epilayer structures, requires no interruption during the growth process, reduces the density of threading dislocation in epi- layers, and enhances light extraction efﬁciency due to the increased probability of light scattering.181 PSS has also been shown to suppress the quantum conﬁned stark effect (QCSE) and improve UV-LED external efﬁciency.182–184 Figure 12 shows a UV-LED with PSS incor- porated.182 As seen in the comparison plot, UV-LED with PSS has a higher output power than a conventional LED at the same injected current The origin of the improved light output power is attributed to the reduction in threading dislocation (TD) induced non-radiative recombination as well as enhanced light extraction due to scattering Increased light output power with pyramidal patterns at both micro- and nanoscale has been reported.185 Nanoscale patterns show more improvement in output power than microscale patterns', 'PSS growth techniques, shape, pattern size, spacing, aspect ratio, and other param- eters have considerable inﬂuence on epilayer quality and eventual LED performance A detailed review of the subject has been presented in the literature.181 B Beam shaping Planar microLEDs have a Lambertian light output distribu- tion.113,114 The luminous intensity of a Lambertian surface is propor- tional to the cosine of the angle between the observed direction and the surface normal The radiant intensity of such a surface is the same when viewed from any angle Uniform radiant intensity is advanta- geous for wide viewing applications such as displays or TVs Other non-display applications such as SIM, optogenetic stimulation, or FIG 11 (a) Schematic diagram of light

focusing on micro- lenses and creating apertures on the top of the mesa structure of microLEDs.186,187 1 Microlens Microlens arrays have been investigated for their focusing ability to achieve uniform far-ﬁeld illumination of targets with laser beams in the past.188 The microscale curved surface of the microlens allows it to focus divergent beamlets onto the illumination plane B€ uttner et al analyzed the beam shaping property of optical systems consisting of light-emitting diode and microlens arrays.189 An integrated microlens array consisting of 128 \\x02 96 elements at the bottom of a microLED array was shown to enable well-resolved light that prevented optical crosstalk.190 The microlens was fabricated using a reﬂow method fol- lowed by etching the sapphire to transfer the pattern with an RMS roughness of less than 3 nm Low roughness is needed for optically high-quality microlenses Figures 13(a) and 13(b) show the schematic diagram of the integrated device and an image demonstrating the focusing ability of the microlens, respectively Zhu et al reported fabri- cating microlens arrays with UV-microLEDs as exposure sources In far-ﬁeld emissions measurements, the integrated device showed a sig- niﬁcant reduction in light divergence.186 The divergence half-angle was reduced by 22\\x03 The incorporation of silica/polystyrene (PS) colloidal microlens array on the top of microLEDs has been shown to increase light extrac- tion at higher angular directions with increased PS thickness and to decrease divergence of light output at smaller PS thicknesses.191 To fur- ther control beam shaping from light emitting diodes, an optical ele- ment combining a Fresnel lens with a microlens array design has been designed and studied for controlling on-axis and off-axis LED emission for lighting applications.192 Continuing on the trend of integrating opti- cal components with LEDs/microLEDs, a combination of total internal reﬂection (TIR) lenses, a reﬂective cavity, and a microlens array plate has been proposed for uniform street lighting using LEDs.193 Additionally, Park et al', 'created a new type of compact optical element that combined a pair of microlens arrays for light collimation from micro-displays for the application of using microLEDs for near-eye dis- plays.194 Demory et al demonstrated HWHM linewidth reduction of 50% in far-ﬁeld emission divergence by integrating nearly ﬂat parabolic nanolenses on the top of nanopillar microLEDs.187 This demonstrates the potential for reducing the size and weight of collimation and projec- tion optics by incorporating microlens arrays 2 TIR Fresnel lens A Fresnel lens is a compact lens that is made up of a set of con- centric annular sections.195 These sections can be viewed as divided surfaces of a

non-imaging devices.197 Additionally, Chen et al reported an optimized Fresnel lens for multi- ple LEDs to achieve uniform lighting for reading applications.198 Other works have shown that Fresnel lenses can collimate LED light for ﬂuorescence microscopy as well.199 Even though many applications of Fresnel lens with LEDs have been shown, a demonstration of its functionality for use with minia- turized optical components was missing To close this gap, Joo et al proposed a TIR Fresnel lens for a miniature electro-optical system that could collimate emitted light from LEDs more effectively.200 The designed lens had a diameter of less than 1 mm and 11 facets on a sin- gle side', 'It successfully reduced the emission solid angle from 60\\x03 to 12\\x03 Researchers have also investigated an electro-optical system that integrated a TIR Fresnel lens into the packaging microlens of LEDs, which can beneﬁt systems that require focused and narrow microLED light emission.201 The work explored the inﬂuence of structural parameters, namely, the height-to-width ratio of the 3D Fresnel-based lens, on beam shaping and showed improved narrowing of the emitted light beam.201 While a Fresnel lens is well-suited to collimate light sources, cer- tain applications requiring uniform lighting from multiple light sour- ces need further re-direction of the light beam.192,193 Wang et al proposed an optical element that combined a Fresnel lens and a microlens to achieve light collimation and further re-direction of colli- mated rays, respectively.192 The proposed design method is versatile with no limitation on the source intensity pattern The resulting opti- cal element is compact and lightweight A major challenge of creating optical systems that use a Fresnel lens for beam shaping is the mathe- matical complexity and intricate optimizations.202,203 One proposed method tackles this issue by using geometric optics analysis to simplify the design process of a free-form lens system The free-form lens con- sisted of a TIR collimator and Fresnel exit lens to produce speciﬁc LED intensity distribution.204 Another challenge for LEDs application is the limited optical power output from a single LED.193 This requires using an array of LEDs/microLEDs to obtain higher optical power These further need integration with an array of lens systems Vu et al presented a design for uniform lighting applications that consisted of a collimating pla- no–convex lens array and two perpendicularly-placed linear Fresnel lenses.205 The physical layout of the illumination system and the simu- lation results showing uniform lighting is shown in Fig 14 While the integration of TIR Fresnel lens systems and LEDs offers solutions to many of the challenges associated with beam shaping, the complex process of design and implementation signiﬁcantly increases the cost of electro-optical systems The addition of optical elements as a part of LED packaging can signiﬁcantly address some of these challenges A detailed review of the optical designs for the LED packaging by Nian et al can be referred to for further insight.206 C Wavelength management techniques There are different techniques that are used to get multiple wave- length emissions from microLEDs One of the most common methods is to change the material composition of the compound semiconduc- tor layer It is done by incorporating higher indium (In) content in the InGaN/GaN alloy which changes the crystal structure and eventually FIG 14 Integration of Fresnel lens in an optical system to achieve uniform

modiﬁes the bandgap of the semiconductor In addition to modifying the lattice constant of the material, adding quantum dots (QD) or phosphors to the mesa surface of microLEDs could enable a single- colored pixel to emit multiple colors.207,208 All three methods to achieve different wavelength emissions are discussed in this section Other techniques such as quantum well (QW) thickness-dependent InGaN/GaN multiple quantum wells (MQW), microfacet emission from MQW, nanowires, and local strain engineering have also been explored in the literature for wavelength tuning in microLEDs.209–213 1 Colloidal Quantum Dots (QDs) QDs are nanoscale semiconductor crystals with distinct proper- ties from those of bulk semiconductors.214,215 Each QD consists of a small inorganic semiconductor core (1–10 nm), a wider-bandgap semiconductor shell, and a coating of passivating ligands.216,217 An atomic force microscopy (AFM) height image of a closely packed monolayer of QDs is shown in Fig 15(c) One of the most useful prop- erties of these nanocrystals is the tunability of their bandgap by varying their size and discrete energy levels also called the quantum conﬁned effect.215,218 Figure 15(a) shows QD solutions of various sizes and composition exhibiting photoluminescence under UV light Figure 15(b) shows the PL spectra of QDs with narrowband emission from visible to NIR Several advantageous properties of QDs such as narrow emission linewidth (20–30 nm for CdSe), high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY > 90%), high photostability, and solution processability make them attractive for applications with microLEDs.126,219 CdSe, with an emission linewidth of 20–30 nm, and PbS are the most commonly used materials for the core of the QDs for visible wavelength and NIR devices, respectively.214,220,221 As mentioned in the application section, microLEDs are used in VLC systems to achieve higher bandwidth and data transfer speeds This has motivated the adoption of white light microLEDs with larger pixel sizes of 100 lm into VLC systems to achieve higher data transfer rates without complicated signal processing.120 As a result, it has become essential to ﬁnd a white light source with wavelength multi- plexing ability for VLC systems Recently, researchers have explored QD-based white light microLEDs for VLC applications Mei et al demonstrated a white light

keying (NRZ-OOK) modulation scheme QD-based microLED arrays for bi-directional optogenetics applications have also been reported.222 They used QDs to create a dual-colored microLED array with emissions at 462 and 623nm This further elucidates the use of QDs in non-display application technologies 2 Phosphor Phosphors are color-converting materials that are essential for achieving full color and are a key component of white lighting sys- tems.5,223,224 Generally, phosphors consist of two functional materials, a host material, and an activator material.225 Host materials are often wide bandgap oxides, nitrides, or sulﬁdes and determine the crystal structure of the phosphor.226–228 Activator materials are usually transi- tion metals or rare earth compounds and are responsible for light emission.225 Both materials play critical roles in determining a phos- phor’s photoluminescent properties, such as emission wavelength and quantum efﬁciency Figure 16(a) shows the crystal structure of a nar- rowband red-emitting phosphor material Sr4[LiAl11N14]:Eu2þ as an example.229 Traditionally, phosphors have been a preferred choice as a down- conversion material for UV-LEDs and blue LEDs to obtain white light sources, due to their high efﬁciency, high stability, and narrow spec- trum.125,229,230 However, phosphors’ larger size can cause signiﬁcant non-uniformity in the color conversion when used with small (50 lm) microLEDs The size of the phosphor can be varied depending upon the preparation process and nano-sized phosphors can be prepared.231 However, the luminous efﬁciency of the phosphor is proportional to its size, and as a result, nano-sized phosphors have lower luminous efﬁciencies.232 FIG 15 (a) Various QDs in chloroform solutions showing

et al presented a high-speed VLC system with a transmission rate of 1.68 Gbps at a distance of 3 cm using white light generated by blue GaN microLEDs and a yellow ﬂuo- rescent converter.123 The high transmission speed is attributed to the high modulation bandwidth of the polymer-based yellow ﬂuorescent layer Huang et al reported a white light VLC system with a 3-dB modulation bandwidth of 127.3 MHz using blue microLEDs and yel- low phosphor.122 Recently, Chang et al', 'reported a white light VLC system that used semi-polar blue microLEDs and yellow phosphors to achieve a data rate of 2.805 Gbps.128 The higher data rate and band- width of the system are attributed to the improved radiative efﬁciency of the semi-polar blue microLEDs resulting from the reduced quantum-conﬁned Stark effect (QCSE) A hybrid strategy of mixing small-sized and large-sized phos- phors can improve the non-uniformity of the system to a great extent with only a small reduction in efﬁciency However, this remains a chal- lenge as mesa dimensions shrink to smaller areas of 5 l m and below.204 Recently, GE has developed a sub-micron sized red phos- phor K2SiF6:Mn4þ (KSF) and KSF inks suitable for microLEDs that can be deposited by low-cost methods such as ink-jet printing, slot die coating, or spin coating.233 These recent developments pave the way for phosphors to be further utilized in microLED applications by over- coming challenges due to their size 3 Compound semiconductor layers Electroluminescence, which is responsible for spontaneous light emission upon the passage of electric current, dates back to 1907 when Round discovered it in silicon carbide (SiC) crystals.234 Further under- standing of materials and luminescent phenomena makes tuning of bandgap an obvious choice for the creation of light emitting diodes of different colors.235–238 Red LEDs have traditionally used AlGaInP crystals, but recent focus has shifted to indium gallium nitride (InGaN) crystals as they offer a wide spectral range from ultraviolet to infrared.239 InGaN bandgap energy can be tuned from 0.67 to 3.42 eV by changing the composition of the alloy.129,240,241 Figure 17 shows the energy bandgap of hexagonal gallium nitride (h-GaN) as a func- tion of lattice constant that is controlled by the indium (In) concentra- tion in the alloy The external quantum efﬁciency (EQE) of the microLED decreases with decreasing device size due to the increased non- radiative recombination, also known as efﬁciency droop.100 While the peak EQE of a 20 \\x02 20 lm blue microLED has been reported to be as high as 33%, AlGaInP-based red microLEDs suffer signiﬁcantly from efﬁciency droop due to high surface recombination and long carrier lifetime at smaller dimensions (<50 lm).242–244 They also suffer from poor thermal stability at high temperatures.245,246 This has resulted in a growing interest in creating red microLEDs that are based on III- nitride materials, in particular InGaN.247,248 The EQE of red

to a large lattice mismatch and low-temperature growth.249 Various fabrication techniques, such as strain engineering, lower growth rates, and high growth temperatures, are required to tackle the low EQE problem facing III-nitride based red microLEDs.250 A more detailed review of the development of red microLEDs can be found in the manuscript from Iida et al.250 Apart from applications in display technologies, the development of different colored efﬁcient microLEDs is important for other applica- tions such as optogenetics The activation or suppression of different cells expressed by different proteins is highly desirable for more precise control over the neuronal activity Red-and-blue-colored microLED-based optoelectronic probes have been used to demonstrate bi-directional neuronal activity manipulation.251,252 Dual-colored microLED arrays have also been used as VLC transmitters and dem- onstrated error-free data rates of 1.79–3.35 Gbps in a dual-wavelength multiplexing scheme.253 Further work is needed to enhance the efﬁ- ciency of longer wavelength microLEDs as longer wavelengths enable deeper neural cell stimulation in optogenetics and wavelength division multiplexing in VLC systems.254,255 V OUTLOOK AND CHALLENGES As discussed in the article, MicroLED/LED technology has been incorporated into a range of applications beyond display applications MicroLEDs based on InGaN/GaN have consistently higher efﬁciencies than competing approaches even as we scale down the device dimen- sions to sub-micron size for blue, green, and red emissions The efﬁ- ciency of the red-colored InGaN/GaN microLEDs can stand further improvement, especially at smaller dimensions The ability to achieve RGB emission from a single material stack will open a wide array of applications with increasingly complex system integration Additionally, the relatively high cost of GaN epi wafers remains a chal- lenge to be addressed, as microLED technology is adopted into a greater number of applications such as point-of-care medical applica- tions like phototherapy and skin treatments.256,257 The adoption of microLEDs in visible light communication (VLC) systems has rapidly grown with improved data transfer rates An increase in the modulation bandwidth is the driving factor for the higher data transfer rates Device miniaturization and the decrease in carrier lifetime of microLEDs can further improve this trend Additionally, VLC systems that use an array of microLEDs as emitters have the potential to enhance the data transfer rates even higher, albeit with the increased system complexity Implementation of VLC in lab- oratory setup is routinely demonstrated, but the real-life system still remains a challenge Many critical issues such as reliability, scalability, and compactness related to the commercialization of the VLC systems remain to be addressed As optogenetics advances our understanding of neural circuits, microLEDs will have an increasingly prevalent role in delivering spa- tially resolved single-neuron stimulation', 'This would require scaling down microLEDs further along and improving external efﬁciency to be able to deliver enough light irradiation to create action potentials The mesa size-related efﬁciency droop needs to be further improved Closed loop stimulation and monitoring of a large ensemble of neu- rons would require large-scale device fabrication Integration with microLED drivers and electrode arrays also needs to be addressed As microLEDs are scaled down to the nanoscale, they will have the potential for an entirely new concept of microscopy, NIM with resolu- tion capabilities surpassing the diffraction limit However, as the microLEDs are miniaturized to nanoscale dimensions, increased non- radiative recombination due to the larger surface-to-volume ratio of the mesa becomes a challenge.15,16 Various mesa sidewall passivation methods, such as dielectric (e.g., SiO2, Al2O3) deposition using plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) and atomic layer deposition (ALD), acid-base etching, hydrogen plasma, and sul- fur treatments, are suggested ways to minimize non-radiative recombi- nation and improve the external quantum efﬁciency.258–261 Progress toward improving the extraction efﬁciency of LEDs using photonic crystals and beam shaping using microlenses has been made, but challenges related to reliable integration with microLEDs remain to be addressed The most common microlens fabrication technique (as the reﬂow method) faces uniformity and control chal- lenges that need to be improved The fabrication of high-quality opti- cal microlenses to minimize scattering is also a challenge Photonic crystal fabrication often requires using electron beam lithography which is expensive and offers a low throughput Simpler and more reliable fabrication techniques need to be developed for further inte- gration with microLEDs and to enable more widespread utilization of these advanced methods The ability to modify the electro-optical properties of microLEDs using various techniques has the potential to enable even more appli- cations beyond displays MicroLEDs can be used further as active ele- ments in chemical sensors for environmental monitoring and optically activating gas sensors to enable room temperature gas sensing.262–264 The potential of microLEDs as a light source for various computa- tional microscopy techniques further remains to be explored More research into eliminating size-scaling related efﬁciency droop as well as compatibility and integration with silicon processing needs to be undertaken to further reduce cost and improve integration These advances will give a much-needed boost to the InGaN/GaN based microLED technology and help develop additional applications with the potential to be ubiquitous in everyday life ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors acknowledge funding support from the National Institutes of Health

applications There are multiple next-generation display demonstrations in the commercial sector Samsung demonstrated a microLED display of 292 inches at CES 2020.12 Jade Bird has demonstrated a microdisplay of 0.3 in with 5000 PPI for AR/VR applications.13 Recently, Compound Photonics unveiled a microdisplay with a record resolution of 8424 PPI.14 The wide interest from the commercial sector to push for the next genera- tion of display technologies using microLEDs has propelled the research effort into improving the key microLED characteristics such as efﬁciency, brightness, full-color emission, and lifetime While microLEDs have been receiving signiﬁcant commercial interest for their use as emitters for display technology, little commer- cial focus has been applied to microLEDs for non-display applications, which is an active area of research (see Fig 1) While high information content displays require a high resolution and small pixels, which can lead to challenges including reduced efﬁciency due to greater non- radiative recombination, higher current density, and degraded extrac- tion,15–18 many of the reviewed non-display applications can beneﬁt from single pixel control and take advantage of relatively efﬁcient, larger pixels Future applications, especially in areas that beneﬁt from ultra-small (e.g., sub micrometer) LEDs, experience some of these challenges and are brieﬂy also discussed MicroLEDs are increasingly being used as a signal emitter in visible light communication (VLC) systems due to their high modulation bandwidth and ability to offer parallel channels for communication using microLED array.19–21 MicroLEDs are also well-suited for optogenetic stimulation, requiring a spatially resolved high-intensity light source.22–24 Multiple computa- tional microscopy techniques, such as structured illumination micros- copy (SIM), for neural imaging have also used microLEDs as light sources.25,26 The high intensity emission in the UV-blue spectrum also makes microLEDs suitable for maskless lithography.27 These non- display applications often require modiﬁcation in the electro-optical characteristics of microLEDs Performance characteristics such as modulation bandwidth, light output power, emission wavelength, and extraction efﬁciency are tailored by integrating additional optical and electrical structures (see Fig 1) The fabrication of the optical struc- tures requires more processing on the top of the microLED structure Despite the progress in fabrication capabilities, a number of challenges remain to be addressed for these applications In this review, we explore microLED electro-optical characteris- tics needed for non-display applications We ﬁrst discuss multiple non-display application areas highlighting key past results and ongo- ing research work We then examine the performance metrics critical for the non-display applications', 'This would require scaling down microLEDs further along and improving external efﬁciency to be able to deliver enough light irradiation to create action potentials The mesa size-related efﬁciency droop needs to be further improved Closed loop stimulation and monitoring of a large ensemble of neu- rons would require large-scale device fabrication Integration with microLED drivers and electrode arrays also needs to be addressed As microLEDs are scaled down to the nanoscale, they will have the potential for an entirely new concept of microscopy, NIM with resolu- tion capabilities surpassing the diffraction limit However, as the microLEDs are miniaturized to nanoscale dimensions, increased non- radiative recombination due to the larger surface-to-volume ratio of the mesa becomes a challenge.15,16 Various mesa sidewall passivation methods, such as dielectric (e.g., SiO2, Al2O3) deposition using plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) and atomic layer deposition (ALD), acid-base etching, hydrogen plasma, and sul- fur treatments, are suggested ways to minimize non-radiative recombi- nation and improve the external quantum efﬁciency.258–261 Progress toward improving the extraction efﬁciency of LEDs using photonic crystals and beam shaping using microlenses has been made, but challenges related to reliable integration with microLEDs remain to be addressed The most common microlens fabrication technique (as the reﬂow method) faces uniformity and control chal- lenges that need to be improved The fabrication of high-quality opti- cal microlenses to minimize scattering is also a challenge Photonic crystal fabrication often requires using electron beam lithography which is expensive and offers a low throughput Simpler and more reliable fabrication techniques need to be developed for further inte- gration with microLEDs and to enable more widespread utilization of these advanced methods The ability to modify the electro-optical properties of microLEDs using various techniques has the potential to enable even more appli- cations beyond displays MicroLEDs can be used further as active ele- ments in chemical sensors for environmental monitoring and optically activating gas sensors to enable room temperature gas sensing.262–264 The potential of microLEDs as a light source for various computa- tional microscopy techniques further remains to be explored More research into eliminating size-scaling related efﬁciency droop as well as compatibility and integration with silicon processing needs to be undertaken to further reduce cost and improve integration These advances will give a much-needed boost to the InGaN/GaN based microLED technology and help develop additional applications with the potential to be ubiquitous in everyday life ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors acknowledge funding support from the

primarily focused toward next-generation display technologies Applications of microLEDs in other technologies, such as projector systems, computational imaging, communication systems, or neural stim- ulation, have been limited In non-display applications which use microLEDs as light sources, modiﬁcations in key electrical and optical char- acteristics such as external efﬁciency, output beam shape,

automobiles, smartphones, home lighting systems, and industrial lighting.1–5 The adoption of LEDs has enabled additional functionalities in the form of longer life- time, more reliable operation, smaller form factor, and lower power consumption in almost every application Much of the effort toward cost reduction in LEDs has been focused on increasing external efﬁciency using improved material growth techniques and optimizing fabrication processes.6 The reduc- tion in high costs of GaN semiconductor-based light emitting diodes is a challenge that needs to be addressed', 'This changes the

low-temperature growth.249 Various fabrication techniques, such as strain engineering, lower growth rates, and high growth temperatures, are required to tackle the low EQE problem facing III-nitride based red microLEDs.250 A more detailed review of the development of red microLEDs can be found in the manuscript from Iida et al.250 Apart from applications in display technologies, the development of different colored efﬁcient microLEDs is important for other applica- tions such as optogenetics The activation or suppression of different cells expressed by different proteins is highly desirable for more precise control over the neuronal activity Red-and-blue-colored microLED-based optoelectronic probes have been used to demonstrate bi-directional neuronal activity manipulation.251,252 Dual-colored microLED arrays have also been used as VLC transmitters and dem- onstrated error-free data rates of 1.79–3.35 Gbps in a dual-wavelength multiplexing scheme.253 Further work is needed to enhance the efﬁ- ciency of longer wavelength microLEDs as longer wavelengths enable deeper neural cell stimulation in optogenetics and wavelength division multiplexing in VLC systems.254,255 V OUTLOOK AND CHALLENGES As discussed in the article, MicroLED/LED technology has been incorporated into a range of applications beyond display applications MicroLEDs based on InGaN/GaN have consistently higher efﬁciencies than competing approaches even as we scale down the device dimen- sions to sub-micron size for blue, green, and red emissions The efﬁ- ciency of the red-colored InGaN/GaN microLEDs can stand further improvement, especially at smaller dimensions The ability to achieve RGB emission from a single material stack will open a wide array of applications with increasingly complex system integration Additionally, the relatively high cost of GaN epi wafers remains a chal- lenge to be addressed, as microLED technology is adopted into a greater number of applications such as point-of-care medical applica- tions like phototherapy and skin treatments.256,257 The adoption of microLEDs in visible light communication (VLC) systems has rapidly grown with improved data transfer rates An increase in the modulation bandwidth is the driving factor for the higher data transfer rates Device miniaturization and the decrease in carrier lifetime of microLEDs can further improve this trend Additionally, VLC systems that use an array of microLEDs as emitters have the potential to enhance the data transfer rates even higher, albeit with the increased system complexity Implementation of VLC in lab- oratory setup is routinely demonstrated, but the real-life system still remains a challenge Many critical issues such as reliability, scalability, and compactness related to the commercialization of the VLC systems remain to be addressed As optogenetics advances our understanding of neural circuits, microLEDs will have an increasingly prevalent role in delivering spa- tially resolved single-neuron stimulation', '(c) Ray-tracing simulation of an illumination system with a free- form optics design The illumination area for simulation is 10 \\x02 20 m2, and the light source

microLEDs could enable a single- colored pixel to emit multiple colors.207,208 All three methods to achieve different wavelength emissions are discussed in this section Other techniques such as quantum well (QW) thickness-dependent InGaN/GaN multiple quantum wells (MQW), microfacet emission from MQW, nanowires, and local strain engineering have also been explored in the literature for wavelength tuning in microLEDs.209–213 1 Colloidal Quantum Dots (QDs) QDs are nanoscale semiconductor crystals with distinct proper- ties from those of bulk semiconductors.214,215 Each QD consists of a small inorganic semiconductor core (1–10 nm), a wider-bandgap semiconductor shell, and a coating of passivating ligands.216,217 An atomic force microscopy (AFM) height image of a closely packed monolayer of QDs is shown in Fig 15(c) One of the most useful prop- erties of these nanocrystals is the tunability of their bandgap by varying their size and discrete energy levels also called the quantum conﬁned effect.215,218 Figure 15(a) shows QD solutions of various sizes and composition exhibiting photoluminescence under UV light Figure 15(b) shows the PL spectra of QDs with narrowband emission from visible to NIR Several advantageous properties of QDs such as narrow emission linewidth (20–30 nm for CdSe), high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY > 90%), high photostability, and solution processability make them attractive for applications with microLEDs.126,219 CdSe, with an emission linewidth of 20–30 nm, and PbS are the most commonly used materials for the core of the QDs for visible wavelength and NIR devices, respectively.214,220,221 As mentioned in the application section, microLEDs are used in VLC systems to achieve higher bandwidth and data transfer speeds This has motivated the adoption of white light microLEDs with larger pixel sizes of 100 lm into VLC systems to achieve higher data transfer rates without complicated signal processing.120 As a result, it has become essential to ﬁnd a white light source with wavelength multi- plexing ability for VLC systems Recently, researchers have explored QD-based white light microLEDs for VLC applications Mei et al demonstrated a white light system that used Perovskite QDs for a high bandwidth VLC system.124 They showed 80 \\x02 80 lm2 microLEDs having a modulation bandwidth of 160 MHz and a peak emission wavelength of approximately 445 nm', 'Deﬁnitions of the key metrics from a non-display application point of view are presented We also highlight optical structures such as photonic crystals,

of the extracted light.147 Researchers have suggested methods including chip shaping, photonic crystals, surface roughness, and mesa shape modiﬁcation to improve the extraction efﬁciency of microLEDs.148–152 This section discusses the techniques for extraction efﬁciency enhancement in the context of various non-display applications 1 Photonic crystals Photonic crystals (PhCs) are repeated dielectric structures of length scales similar to the wavelength of light.148,153,154 These crystals have the capability to modify spontaneous light emission by creating a photonic bandgap that can interact with the electronic bandgap of the emission material.155 The photonic bandgap can be utilized in two ways to increase the extraction efﬁciency: inhibiting the emission of the guided modes or redirecting trapped light into radiated modes The photonic crystals should be physically very close to the active light emitting region to maximize their impact Wierer et al demonstrated electrically operated InGaN/GaN LEDs with photonic crystals having a tunnel junction to provide lateral current spreading to the photonics crystals.154 This work reports increased microLED radiance and an approximately 1.5x total increase in light extraction with photonic crystals incorporation Additionally, the far-ﬁeld radiation pattern of LEDs with PhC was also radically different than planar LEDs.154 Oder et al demonstrated extraction efﬁciency enhancement of 63% in InGaN/GaN blue (460 nm) microLEDs and 95% in AlInGaN/ GaN UV (340 nm) microLEDs', 'further advanced the tech- nique by combining a CMOS-controlled microLED array with a projection system and translation stage to achieve written features as small as 8 lm.27 Building further on the same setup, Guilhabert et al reported mask-fee direct pattern writing with features as small as 500 nm by primarily modifying the projection optics.96 They also showed the fabrication of InGaN micro-LEDs using the same setup Recently, Wu

enabling performance properties Table I summarizes the reviewed non-display applications and the key desirable properties MicroLED technology offers superior performance than organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) for key properties such as brightness, response time, and lifetime Table II summarizes the performance comparison between the microLEDs and OLED technology.99 Many of the metrics, such as superior brightness, reliability, and lifetime, make microLEDs well-suited to both display and non-display, but some of the key performance metrics for non-display applications dif- fer from those for display applications This section discusses the key performance parameters of microLEDs that must be optimized or enhanced for non-display applications These metrics include optical extraction, angle of extraction, modulation bandwidth, light output power, and response time FIG 6 (a) A micro-projection system used for maskless UV photolithography The system consists of CMOS driven microLED

quantum efﬁciencies (IQEs) that can exceed ninety percent as a result of advances in growth techniques that have yielded high-quality materials and crystal structures.100–103 However, the external quantum efﬁciency (EQE) of GaN-based microLEDs, deﬁned as the ratio of the number of photons emitted vs the number of photons internally generated, is comparatively low with a peak EQE of generally smaller than 15%.104–106 The EQE of the microLEDs can be viewed as the product of two separate efﬁciencies: IQE and light extraction efﬁciency (LEE).107 While IQE is signiﬁcantly improved over the years, LEE has been a limiting factor.100,108,109 Low LEE is primarily due to the large refractive index difference between air and semiconductors that traps light from total internal reﬂection (TIR) and Fresnel loss at the interface.110 For example, the external efﬁciency could be as low as 4.3% in a typical semiconductor material with a refractive index of 2.4', 'reported a white light VLC system that used semi-polar blue microLEDs and yellow phosphors to achieve a data rate of 2.805 Gbps.128 The higher data rate and band- width of the system are attributed to the improved radiative efﬁciency of the semi-polar blue microLEDs resulting from the reduced quantum-conﬁned Stark effect (QCSE) A hybrid strategy of mixing small-sized and large-sized phos- phors can improve the non-uniformity of the system to a great extent with only a small reduction in efﬁciency However, this remains a chal- lenge as mesa dimensions shrink to smaller areas of 5 l m and below.204 Recently, GE has developed a sub-micron sized red phos- phor K2SiF6:Mn4þ (KSF) and KSF inks suitable for microLEDs that can be deposited by low-cost methods such as ink-jet printing, slot die coating, or spin coating.233 These recent developments pave the way for phosphors to be further utilized in microLED applications by over- coming challenges due to their size 3 Compound semiconductor layers Electroluminescence, which is responsible for spontaneous light emission upon the passage of electric current, dates back to 1907 when Round discovered it in silicon carbide (SiC) crystals.234 Further under- standing of materials and luminescent phenomena makes tuning of bandgap an obvious choice for the creation of light emitting diodes of different colors.235–238 Red LEDs have traditionally used AlGaInP crystals, but recent focus has shifted to indium gallium nitride (InGaN) crystals as they offer a wide spectral range from ultraviolet to infrared.239 InGaN bandgap energy can be tuned from 0.67 to 3.42 eV by changing the composition of the alloy.129,240,241 Figure 17 shows the energy bandgap of hexagonal gallium nitride (h-GaN) as a func- tion of lattice constant that is controlled by the indium (In) concentra- tion in the alloy The external quantum efﬁciency (EQE) of the microLED decreases with decreasing device size due to the increased non- radiative recombination, also known as efﬁciency droop.100 While the peak EQE of a 20 \\x02 20 lm blue microLED has been reported to be as high as 33%, AlGaInP-based red microLEDs suffer signiﬁcantly from efﬁciency droop due to high surface recombination and long carrier lifetime at smaller dimensions (<50 lm).242–244 They also suffer from poor thermal stability at high temperatures.245,246 This has resulted in a growing interest in creating red microLEDs that are based on III- nitride materials, in particular InGaN.247,248 The EQE of red InGaN FIG 16 Phosphor structure and emission spectrum (a) The crystal structure of a nar-

high-efﬁciency red, green, and blue LEDs using InGaN/GaN semiconductors is further paving way for new applications.7–9 One of the most widely anticipated applications of microLEDs and RGB capability is in next-generation self-emissive display technol- ogy.10,11 The adoption of microLEDs in display devices is expected to enable much brighter, broader color gamut, longer lifetime, and extremely high pixels per inch (PPI) displays A number of these char- acteristics are especially highly desirable in displays for augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications There are multiple next-generation display demonstrations in the commercial sector Samsung demonstrated a microLED display of 292 inches at CES 2020.12 Jade Bird has demonstrated a microdisplay of 0.3 in with 5000 PPI for AR/VR applications.13 Recently, Compound Photonics unveiled a microdisplay with a record resolution of 8424 PPI.14 The wide interest from the commercial sector to push for the next genera- tion of display technologies using microLEDs has propelled the research effort into improving the key microLED characteristics such as efﬁciency, brightness, full-color emission, and lifetime While microLEDs have been receiving signiﬁcant commercial interest for their use as emitters for display technology, little commer- cial focus has been applied to microLEDs for non-display applications, which is an active area of research (see Fig 1) While high information content displays require a high resolution and small pixels, which can lead to challenges including reduced efﬁciency due to greater non- radiative recombination, higher current density, and degraded extrac- tion,15–18 many of the reviewed non-display applications can beneﬁt from single pixel control and take advantage of relatively efﬁcient, larger pixels Future applications, especially in areas that beneﬁt from ultra-small (e.g., sub micrometer) LEDs, experience some of these challenges and are brieﬂy also discussed MicroLEDs are increasingly being used as a signal emitter in visible light communication (VLC) systems due to their high modulation bandwidth and ability to offer parallel channels for communication using microLED array.19–21 MicroLEDs are also well-suited for optogenetic stimulation, requiring a spatially resolved high-intensity light source.22–24 Multiple computa- tional microscopy techniques, such as structured illumination micros- copy (SIM), for neural imaging have also used microLEDs as light sources.25,26 The high intensity emission in the UV-blue spectrum also makes microLEDs suitable for maskless lithography.27 These non- display applications often require modiﬁcation in the electro-optical characteristics of microLEDs Performance characteristics such as modulation bandwidth, light output power, emission wavelength, and extraction efﬁciency are tailored by integrating additional optical and electrical structures (see Fig 1) The fabrication of the optical struc- tures requires more processing on the top of the microLED structure Despite the progress in fabrication capabilities, a number of challenges remain to be addressed for these applications In this review, we explore microLED electro-optical characteris- tics needed for non-display applications We ﬁrst discuss multiple non-display application areas highlighting key past results and ongo- ing research work We then examine the performance metrics critical for the non-display applications', 'This would require scaling down microLEDs further along and improving external efﬁciency to be able to deliver enough light irradiation to create action potentials The mesa size-related efﬁciency droop needs to be further improved Closed loop stimulation and monitoring of a large ensemble of neu- rons would require large-scale device fabrication Integration with microLED drivers and electrode arrays also needs to be addressed As microLEDs are scaled down to the nanoscale, they will have the potential for an entirely new concept of microscopy, NIM with resolu- tion capabilities surpassing the diffraction limit However, as the microLEDs are miniaturized to nanoscale dimensions, increased non- radiative recombination due to the larger surface-to-volume ratio of the mesa becomes a challenge.15,16 Various mesa sidewall passivation methods, such as dielectric (e.g., SiO2, Al2O3) deposition using plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) and atomic layer deposition (ALD), acid-base etching, hydrogen plasma, and sul- fur treatments, are suggested ways to minimize non-radiative recombi- nation and improve the external quantum efﬁciency.258–261 Progress toward improving the extraction efﬁciency of LEDs using photonic crystals and beam shaping using microlenses has been made, but challenges related to reliable integration with microLEDs remain to be addressed The most common microlens fabrication technique (as the reﬂow method) faces uniformity and control chal- lenges that need to be improved The fabrication of high-quality opti- cal microlenses to minimize scattering is also a challenge Photonic crystal fabrication often requires using electron beam lithography which is expensive and offers a low throughput Simpler and more reliable fabrication techniques need to be developed for further inte- gration with microLEDs and to enable more widespread utilization of these advanced methods The ability to modify the electro-optical properties of microLEDs using various techniques has the potential to enable even more appli- cations beyond displays MicroLEDs can be used further as active ele- ments in chemical sensors for environmental monitoring and optically activating gas sensors to enable room temperature gas sensing.262–264 The potential of microLEDs as a light source for various computa- tional microscopy techniques further remains to be explored More research into eliminating size-scaling related efﬁciency droop as well as compatibility and integration with silicon processing needs to be undertaken to further reduce cost and improve integration These advances will give a much-needed boost to the InGaN/GaN based microLED technology and help develop additional applications with the potential to be ubiquitous in everyday life ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors acknowledge funding support from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) through

techniques, such as strain engineering, lower growth rates, and high growth temperatures, are required to tackle the low EQE problem facing III-nitride based red microLEDs.250 A more detailed review of the development of red microLEDs can be found in the manuscript from Iida et al.250 Apart from applications in display technologies, the development of different colored efﬁcient microLEDs is important for other applica- tions such as optogenetics The activation or suppression of different cells expressed by different proteins is highly desirable for more precise control over the neuronal activity Red-and-blue-colored microLED-based optoelectronic probes have been used to demonstrate bi-directional neuronal activity manipulation.251,252 Dual-colored microLED arrays have also been used as VLC transmitters and dem- onstrated error-free data rates of 1.79–3.35 Gbps in a dual-wavelength multiplexing scheme.253 Further work is needed to enhance the efﬁ- ciency of longer wavelength microLEDs as longer wavelengths enable deeper neural cell stimulation in optogenetics and wavelength division multiplexing in VLC systems.254,255 V OUTLOOK AND CHALLENGES As discussed in the article, MicroLED/LED technology has been incorporated into a range of applications beyond display applications MicroLEDs based on InGaN/GaN have consistently higher efﬁciencies than competing approaches even

smaller dimensions The ability to achieve RGB emission from a single material stack will open a wide array of applications with increasingly complex system integration Additionally, the relatively high cost of GaN epi wafers remains a chal- lenge to be addressed, as microLED technology is adopted into a greater number of applications such as point-of-care medical applica- tions like phototherapy and skin treatments.256,257 The adoption of microLEDs in visible light communication (VLC) systems has rapidly grown with improved data transfer rates An increase in the modulation bandwidth is the driving factor for the higher data transfer rates Device miniaturization and the decrease in carrier lifetime of microLEDs can further improve this trend Additionally, VLC systems that use an array of microLEDs as emitters have the potential to enhance the data transfer rates even higher, albeit with the increased system complexity Implementation of VLC in lab- oratory setup is routinely demonstrated, but the real-life system still remains a challenge Many critical issues such as reliability, scalability, and compactness related to the commercialization of the VLC systems

modiﬁes the bandgap of the semiconductor In addition to modifying the lattice constant of the material, adding quantum dots (QD) or phosphors to the mesa surface of microLEDs could enable a single- colored pixel to emit multiple colors.207,208 All three methods to achieve different wavelength emissions are discussed in this section Other techniques such as quantum well (QW) thickness-dependent InGaN/GaN multiple quantum wells (MQW), microfacet emission from MQW, nanowires, and local strain engineering have also been explored in the literature for wavelength tuning in microLEDs.209–213 1 Colloidal Quantum Dots (QDs) QDs are nanoscale semiconductor crystals with distinct proper- ties from those of bulk semiconductors.214,215 Each QD consists of a small inorganic semiconductor core (1–10 nm), a wider-bandgap semiconductor shell, and a coating of passivating ligands.216,217 An atomic force microscopy (AFM) height image of a closely packed monolayer of QDs is shown in Fig 15(c) One of the most useful prop- erties of these nanocrystals is the tunability of their bandgap by varying their size and discrete energy levels also called the quantum conﬁned effect.215,218 Figure 15(a) shows QD solutions of various sizes and composition exhibiting photoluminescence under UV light Figure 15(b) shows the PL spectra of QDs with narrowband emission from visible to NIR Several advantageous properties of QDs such as narrow emission linewidth (20–30 nm for CdSe), high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY > 90%), high photostability, and solution processability make them attractive for applications with microLEDs.126,219 CdSe, with an emission linewidth of 20–30 nm, and PbS are the most commonly used materials for the core of the QDs for visible wavelength and NIR devices, respectively.214,220,221 As mentioned in the application section, microLEDs are used in VLC systems to achieve higher bandwidth and data transfer speeds This has motivated the adoption of white light microLEDs with larger pixel sizes of 100 lm into VLC systems to achieve higher data transfer rates without complicated signal processing.120 As a result, it has become essential to ﬁnd a

red microLEDs can be found in the manuscript from Iida et al.250 Apart from applications in display technologies, the development of different colored efﬁcient microLEDs is important for other

the output performance Key optical compo- nents that can enhance the performance metrics of microLEDs and make them more suitable for use in non-display applications are dis- cussed in Secs IVA–V A

of the extracted light.147 Researchers have suggested methods including chip shaping, photonic crystals, surface roughness, and mesa shape modiﬁcation to improve the extraction efﬁciency of microLEDs.148–152 This section discusses the techniques for extraction efﬁciency enhancement in the context of various non-display applications 1 Photonic crystals Photonic crystals (PhCs) are repeated dielectric structures of length scales similar to the wavelength of light.148,153,154 These crystals have the capability to modify spontaneous light emission by creating a photonic bandgap that can interact with the electronic bandgap of the emission material.155 The photonic bandgap can be utilized in two ways to increase the extraction efﬁciency: inhibiting the emission of the guided modes or redirecting trapped light into radiated modes The photonic crystals should be physically very close to the active light emitting region to maximize their impact Wierer et al demonstrated electrically operated InGaN/GaN LEDs with photonic crystals having a tunnel junction to provide lateral current spreading to the photonics crystals.154 This work reports increased microLED radiance and an approximately 1.5x total increase in light extraction with photonic crystals incorporation Additionally, the far-ﬁeld radiation pattern of LEDs with PhC was also radically different than planar LEDs.154 Oder et al demonstrated extraction efﬁciency enhancement of 63% in InGaN/GaN blue (460 nm) microLEDs and 95% in AlInGaN/ GaN UV (340 nm) microLEDs', 'further advanced the tech- nique by

quantum efﬁciencies (IQEs) that can exceed ninety percent as a result of advances in growth techniques that have yielded high-quality materials and crystal structures.100–103 However, the external quantum efﬁciency (EQE) of GaN-based microLEDs, deﬁned as the ratio of the number of photons emitted vs the number of photons internally generated, is comparatively low with a peak EQE of generally smaller than 15%.104–106 The EQE of the microLEDs can be viewed as the product of two separate efﬁciencies: IQE and light extraction efﬁciency (LEE).107 While IQE is signiﬁcantly improved over the years, LEE has been a limiting factor.100,108,109 Low LEE is primarily due to the large refractive index difference between air and semiconductors that traps light from total internal reﬂection (TIR) and Fresnel loss at the interface.110 For example, the external efﬁciency could be as low as 4.3% in a typical semiconductor material with a refractive index of 2.4', 'reported a white light VLC system that used semi-polar blue microLEDs and yellow phosphors to achieve a data rate of 2.805 Gbps.128 The higher data rate and band- width of the system are attributed to the improved radiative efﬁciency of the semi-polar blue microLEDs resulting from the reduced quantum-conﬁned Stark effect (QCSE) A hybrid strategy of mixing small-sized and large-sized phos- phors can improve the non-uniformity of the system to a great extent with only a small reduction in efﬁciency However, this remains a chal- lenge as mesa dimensions shrink to smaller areas of 5 l m and below.204 Recently, GE has developed a sub-micron sized red phos- phor K2SiF6:Mn4þ (KSF) and KSF inks suitable for microLEDs that can be deposited by low-cost methods such as ink-jet printing, slot die coating, or spin coating.233 These recent developments pave the way for phosphors to be further utilized in microLED applications by over- coming challenges due to their size 3 Compound semiconductor layers Electroluminescence, which is responsible for spontaneous light emission upon the passage of electric current, dates back to 1907 when Round discovered it in silicon carbide (SiC) crystals.234 Further under- standing of materials and luminescent phenomena makes tuning of bandgap an obvious choice for the creation of light emitting diodes of different colors.235–238 Red LEDs have traditionally used AlGaInP crystals, but recent focus has shifted to indium gallium nitride (InGaN) crystals as they offer a wide spectral range from ultraviolet to infrared.239 InGaN bandgap energy can be tuned from 0.67 to 3.42 eV by changing the composition of the alloy.129,240,241 Figure 17 shows the energy bandgap of hexagonal gallium nitride (h-GaN) as a func- tion of lattice constant that is controlled by the indium (In) concentra- tion in the alloy The external quantum efﬁciency (EQE) of the microLED decreases with decreasing device size due to the increased non- radiative recombination, also known as efﬁciency droop.100 While the peak EQE of a 20 \\x02 20 lm blue microLED has been reported to be as high as 33%, AlGaInP-based red microLEDs suffer signiﬁcantly from efﬁciency droop due to high surface recombination and long carrier lifetime at smaller dimensions (<50 lm).242–244 They also suffer from poor thermal stability at high temperatures.245,246 This has resulted in a growing interest in creating red microLEDs that are based on III- nitride materials, in particular InGaN.247,248 The EQE of red InGaN FIG 16 Phosphor structure and emission spectrum (a) The crystal structure of a nar-

applications which use microLEDs as light sources, modiﬁcations in key electrical and optical char- acteristics such as external efﬁciency, output beam shape, modulation bandwidth, light output power,

visible light communication (VLC) systems has been investigated both as emitter devices and as photode- tectors (PD).19–21,34 The VLC system, shown in Fig 2(c), consists of three primary components: an optical transmitter, an optical channel, and a receiver.35 The optical transmitter contains the waveform gener- ator, encoders, driver electronics, microLED emitters, and transmitter optics The

is still notably low because increasing indium (In) content in the alloy degrades crystal quality due to a large lattice mismatch and low-temperature growth.249 Various fabrication techniques, such as strain engineering, lower growth rates, and high growth temperatures, are required to tackle the low EQE problem facing III-nitride based red microLEDs.250 A more detailed review of the development of red microLEDs can be found in the manuscript from Iida et al.250 Apart from applications in display technologies, the development of different colored efﬁcient microLEDs is important for other applica- tions such as optogenetics The activation or suppression of different cells expressed by different proteins is highly desirable for more precise control over the neuronal activity Red-and-blue-colored microLED-based optoelectronic probes have been used to demonstrate bi-directional neuronal activity manipulation.251,252 Dual-colored microLED arrays have also been used as VLC transmitters and dem- onstrated error-free data rates of 1.79–3.35 Gbps in a dual-wavelength multiplexing scheme.253 Further work is needed to enhance the efﬁ- ciency of longer wavelength microLEDs as longer wavelengths enable deeper neural cell stimulation in optogenetics and wavelength division multiplexing in VLC systems.254,255 V OUTLOOK AND CHALLENGES As discussed in the article, MicroLED/LED technology has been incorporated into a range of applications beyond display applications MicroLEDs based on InGaN/GaN have consistently higher efﬁciencies than competing approaches even as we scale down the device dimen- sions to sub-micron size for blue, green, and red emissions The efﬁ- ciency of the red-colored InGaN/GaN microLEDs can stand further improvement, especially at smaller dimensions The ability to achieve RGB emission from a single material stack will open a wide array of applications with increasingly complex system integration Additionally, the relatively high cost of GaN epi wafers remains a chal- lenge to be addressed, as microLED technology is adopted into a greater number of applications such as point-of-care medical applica- tions like phototherapy and skin treatments.256,257 The adoption of microLEDs in visible light communication (VLC) systems has rapidly grown with improved data transfer rates An increase in the modulation bandwidth is the driving factor for the higher data transfer rates Device miniaturization and the decrease in carrier lifetime of microLEDs can further improve this trend Additionally, VLC systems that use an array of microLEDs as emitters have the potential to enhance the data transfer rates even higher, albeit with the increased system complexity Implementation of VLC in lab- oratory setup is routinely demonstrated, but the real-life system still remains a challenge Many critical issues such as reliability, scalability, and compactness related to the commercialization of the VLC systems remain to be addressed As optogenetics advances our understanding of neural circuits, microLEDs will have an increasingly prevalent role in delivering spa- tially resolved single-neuron stimulation', 'OPTICAL STRUCTURES FOR IMPROVED PERFORMANCE Despite the superior performance of microLEDs when compared with OLEDs, modiﬁcation in the key properties of microLEDs is often required for non-display applications Electro-optical components such as photonic crystals, nanostructures, microlenses, Fresnel lenses, quantum dots, phosphors, etc., are integrated with the traditional microLEDs to improve the output performance Key optical compo- nents that can enhance the performance metrics of microLEDs and make them more suitable for use in non-display applications are dis- cussed in Secs IVA–V A Extraction efficiency enhancement The low extraction efﬁciency of microLEDs originates from the traditionally grown epilayer structure of the GaN LEDs.6,106,144 A typi- cal GaN epi structure is grown hetero-epitaxially on a sapphire sub- strate due to the lack of availability of a suitable substrate for homoepitaxial growth.145,146 The photons generated inside the GaN FIG 9 A graph showing the 3-dB modulation bandwidth of microLEDs as a func- tion of current density for different pixel sizes ranging from 60 to 160 lm The mod- ulation bandwidth initially increases as the current density of

of the extracted light.147 Researchers have suggested methods including chip shaping, photonic crystals, surface roughness, and mesa shape modiﬁcation to improve the extraction efﬁciency of microLEDs.148–152 This section discusses the techniques for extraction efﬁciency enhancement in the context of various non-display applications 1 Photonic crystals Photonic crystals (PhCs) are repeated dielectric structures of length scales similar to the wavelength of light.148,153,154 These crystals have the capability to modify spontaneous light emission by creating a photonic bandgap that can interact with the electronic bandgap of the emission material.155 The photonic bandgap can be utilized in two ways to increase the extraction efﬁciency: inhibiting the emission of the guided modes or redirecting trapped light into radiated modes The photonic crystals should be physically very close to the active light emitting region to maximize their impact Wierer et al demonstrated electrically operated InGaN/GaN LEDs with photonic crystals having a tunnel junction to provide lateral current spreading to the photonics crystals.154 This work reports increased microLED radiance and an approximately 1.5x total increase in light extraction with photonic crystals incorporation Additionally, the far-ﬁeld radiation pattern of LEDs with PhC was also radically different than planar LEDs.154 Oder et al demonstrated extraction efﬁciency enhancement of 63% in InGaN/GaN blue (460 nm) microLEDs and 95% in AlInGaN/ GaN UV (340 nm) microLEDs', 'further advanced the tech- nique by combining a CMOS-controlled microLED array with a projection system and translation stage to achieve written features as small as 8 lm.27 Building further on the same setup, Guilhabert et al reported mask-fee direct pattern writing with features as small as 500 nm by primarily modifying the projection optics.96 They also showed the fabrication of InGaN micro-LEDs using the same setup Recently, Wu

enabling performance properties Table I summarizes the reviewed non-display applications and the key desirable properties MicroLED technology offers superior performance than organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) for key properties such as brightness, response time, and lifetime Table II summarizes the performance comparison between the microLEDs and OLED technology.99 Many of the metrics, such as superior brightness, reliability, and lifetime, make microLEDs well-suited to both display and non-display, but some of the key performance metrics for non-display applications dif- fer from those for display applications This section discusses the key performance parameters of microLEDs that must be optimized or enhanced for non-display applications These metrics include optical extraction,

quantum efﬁciencies (IQEs) that can exceed ninety percent as a result of advances in growth techniques that have yielded high-quality materials and crystal structures.100–103 However, the external quantum efﬁciency (EQE) of GaN-based microLEDs, deﬁned as the ratio of the number of photons emitted vs the number of photons internally generated, is comparatively low with a peak EQE of generally smaller than 15%.104–106 The EQE of the microLEDs can be viewed as the product of two separate efﬁciencies: IQE and light extraction efﬁciency (LEE).107 While IQE is signiﬁcantly improved over the years, LEE has been a limiting factor.100,108,109 Low LEE is primarily due to the large refractive index difference between air and semiconductors that traps light from total internal reﬂection (TIR) and Fresnel loss at the interface.110 For example, the external efﬁciency could be as low as 4.3% in a typical semiconductor material with a refractive index of 2.4', 'reported a white light VLC system that used semi-polar blue microLEDs and yellow phosphors to achieve a data rate of 2.805 Gbps.128 The higher data rate and band- width of the system are attributed to the improved radiative efﬁciency of the semi-polar blue microLEDs resulting from the reduced quantum-conﬁned Stark effect (QCSE) A hybrid strategy of mixing small-sized and large-sized phos- phors can improve the non-uniformity of the system to a great extent with only a small reduction in efﬁciency However, this remains a chal- lenge as mesa dimensions shrink to smaller areas of 5 l m and below.204 Recently, GE has developed a sub-micron sized red phos- phor K2SiF6:Mn4þ (KSF) and KSF inks suitable for microLEDs that can be deposited by low-cost methods such as ink-jet printing, slot die coating, or spin coating.233 These recent developments pave the way for phosphors to be further utilized in microLED applications by over- coming challenges due to their size 3 Compound semiconductor layers Electroluminescence, which is responsible for spontaneous light emission upon the passage of electric current, dates back to 1907 when Round discovered it in silicon carbide (SiC) crystals.234 Further under- standing of materials and luminescent phenomena makes tuning of bandgap an obvious choice for the creation of light emitting diodes of different colors.235–238 Red LEDs have traditionally used AlGaInP crystals, but recent focus has shifted to indium gallium nitride (InGaN) crystals as they offer a wide spectral range from ultraviolet to infrared.239 InGaN bandgap energy can be tuned from 0.67 to 3.42 eV by changing the composition of the alloy.129,240,241 Figure 17 shows the energy bandgap of hexagonal gallium nitride (h-GaN) as a func- tion of lattice constant that is controlled by the indium (In) concentra- tion in the alloy The external quantum efﬁciency (EQE) of the microLED decreases with decreasing device size due to the increased non- radiative recombination, also known as efﬁciency droop.100 While the peak EQE of a 20 \\x02 20 lm blue microLED has been reported to be as high as 33%, AlGaInP-based red microLEDs suffer signiﬁcantly from efﬁciency droop due to high surface recombination and long carrier lifetime at smaller dimensions (<50 lm).242–244 They also suffer from poor thermal stability at high temperatures.245,246 This has resulted in a growing interest in creating red microLEDs that are based on III- nitride materials, in particular InGaN.247,248 The EQE of red InGaN FIG 16 Phosphor structure and emission spectrum (a) The crystal structure of a nar-

applications are discussed The schematic diagram encom- passing the review is shown in Fig 1 II NON-DISPLAY APPLICATION AREAS MicroLEDs have been extensively explored as pixels for next- generation displays with ultra-high brightness, deeper color gamut, and longer lifetime.28–31 The high luminance, energy efﬁciency, reli- ability, low cost, and bio-compatibility of microLEDs also enable them to be used in various non-display technologies such as visible light communications (VLC), photolithography, optogenetics stimulation, light sources for structured illumination microscopy (SIM), and super- resolution imaging.22,25–27,32,33 This section focuses on the system setup and recent progress of each of these applications A Visible Light Communication (VLC) The usage of microLEDs in visible light communication (VLC) systems has been investigated both as emitter devices and as photode- tectors (PD).19–21,34 The VLC system, shown in Fig 2(c), consists of three primary components: an optical transmitter, an optical channel, and a receiver.35 The optical transmitter contains the waveform gener- ator, encoders, driver electronics, microLED emitters, and transmitter optics The optical channel allows for data transfer through air or another desired medium The receiver contains receiver optics, photo- detectors, ampliﬁers, and decoders The schematic diagram of a mea- surement setup for frequency response characterization having similar components is also shown in Fig 2(a) The lower RC values of microLEDs arising from their small size (1–100 lm) and short carrier lifetime result in a high modulation bandwidth A higher 3-dB modulation bandwidth allows a higher data rate transfer in the communication system These characteristics make microLEDs an attractive choice for

is still notably low because increasing indium (In) content in the alloy degrades crystal quality due to a large lattice mismatch and low-temperature growth.249 Various fabrication techniques, such as strain engineering, lower growth rates, and high growth temperatures, are required to tackle the low EQE problem facing III-nitride based red microLEDs.250 A more detailed review of the development of red microLEDs can be found in the manuscript from Iida et al.250 Apart from applications in display technologies, the development of different colored efﬁcient microLEDs is important for other applica- tions such as optogenetics The activation or suppression of different cells expressed by different proteins is highly desirable for more precise control over the neuronal activity Red-and-blue-colored microLED-based optoelectronic probes have been used to demonstrate bi-directional neuronal activity manipulation.251,252 Dual-colored microLED arrays have also been used as VLC transmitters and dem- onstrated error-free data rates of 1.79–3.35 Gbps in a dual-wavelength multiplexing scheme.253 Further work is needed to enhance the efﬁ- ciency of longer wavelength microLEDs as longer wavelengths enable deeper neural cell stimulation in optogenetics and wavelength division multiplexing in VLC systems.254,255 V OUTLOOK AND CHALLENGES As discussed in the article, MicroLED/LED technology has been incorporated into a range of applications beyond display applications MicroLEDs based on InGaN/GaN have consistently higher efﬁciencies than competing approaches even as we scale down the device dimen- sions to sub-micron size for blue, green, and red emissions The efﬁ- ciency of the red-colored InGaN/GaN microLEDs can stand further improvement, especially at smaller dimensions The ability to achieve RGB emission from a single material stack will open a wide array of applications with increasingly complex system integration Additionally, the relatively high cost of GaN epi wafers remains a chal- lenge to be addressed, as microLED technology is adopted into a greater number of applications such as point-of-care medical applica- tions like phototherapy and skin treatments.256,257 The adoption of microLEDs in visible light communication (VLC) systems has rapidly grown with improved data transfer rates An increase in the modulation bandwidth is the driving factor for the higher data transfer rates Device miniaturization and the decrease in carrier lifetime of microLEDs can further improve this trend Additionally, VLC systems that use an array of microLEDs as emitters have the potential to enhance the data transfer rates even higher, albeit with the increased system complexity Implementation of VLC in lab- oratory setup is routinely demonstrated, but the real-life system still remains a challenge Many critical issues such as reliability, scalability, and compactness related to the commercialization of the VLC systems remain to be addressed As optogenetics advances our understanding of neural circuits, microLEDs will have an increasingly prevalent role in delivering spa- tially resolved single-neuron stimulation', 'OPTICAL STRUCTURES FOR IMPROVED PERFORMANCE Despite the superior performance of microLEDs when compared with OLEDs, modiﬁcation in the key properties of microLEDs is often required for non-display applications Electro-optical components such as photonic crystals, nanostructures, microlenses, Fresnel lenses, quantum dots, phosphors, etc., are integrated with the traditional microLEDs to improve the output performance Key optical compo- nents that can enhance the performance metrics of microLEDs and make them more suitable for use in non-display applications are dis- cussed in Secs IVA–V A Extraction efficiency enhancement The low extraction efﬁciency of microLEDs originates from the traditionally grown epilayer structure of the GaN LEDs.6,106,144 A typi- cal GaN epi structure is grown hetero-epitaxially on a sapphire sub- strate due to the lack of availability of a suitable substrate for homoepitaxial growth.145,146 The photons generated inside the GaN FIG 9 A graph showing the 3-dB modulation bandwidth of microLEDs as a func- tion of current density for different pixel sizes ranging from 60 to 160 lm The mod- ulation bandwidth initially increases as the current density of

of the extracted light.147 Researchers have suggested methods including chip shaping, photonic crystals, surface roughness, and mesa shape modiﬁcation to improve the extraction efﬁciency of microLEDs.148–152 This section discusses the techniques for extraction efﬁciency enhancement in the context of various non-display applications 1 Photonic crystals Photonic crystals (PhCs) are repeated dielectric structures of length scales similar to the wavelength of light.148,153,154 These crystals have the capability to modify spontaneous light emission by creating a photonic bandgap that can interact with the electronic bandgap of the emission material.155 The photonic bandgap can be utilized in two ways to increase the extraction efﬁciency: inhibiting the emission of the guided modes or redirecting trapped light into radiated modes The photonic crystals should be physically very close to the active light emitting region to maximize their impact Wierer et al demonstrated electrically operated InGaN/GaN LEDs with photonic crystals having a tunnel junction to provide lateral current spreading to the photonics crystals.154 This work reports increased microLED radiance and an approximately 1.5x total increase in light extraction with photonic crystals incorporation Additionally, the far-ﬁeld radiation pattern of LEDs with PhC was also radically different than planar LEDs.154 Oder et al demonstrated extraction efﬁciency enhancement of 63% in InGaN/GaN blue (460 nm) microLEDs and 95% in AlInGaN/ GaN UV (340 nm) microLEDs', 'further advanced the tech- nique by combining a CMOS-controlled microLED array with a projection system and translation stage to achieve written features as small as 8 lm.27 Building further on the same setup, Guilhabert et al reported mask-fee direct pattern writing with features as small as 500 nm by primarily modifying the projection optics.96 They also showed the fabrication of InGaN micro-LEDs using the same setup Recently, Wu

diodes (OLEDs) for key properties such as brightness, response time, and lifetime Table II summarizes the performance comparison between the microLEDs and OLED technology.99 Many of the metrics, such as superior brightness, reliability, and lifetime, make microLEDs well-suited to both display and non-display, but some of the key performance metrics for non-display applications dif- fer from those for display applications This section discusses the key performance parameters of microLEDs that must be optimized or enhanced for non-display applications These metrics include optical extraction,

quantum efﬁciencies (IQEs) that can exceed ninety percent as a result of advances in growth techniques that have yielded high-quality materials and crystal structures.100–103 However, the external quantum efﬁciency (EQE) of GaN-based microLEDs, deﬁned as the ratio of the number of photons emitted vs the number of photons internally generated, is comparatively low with a peak EQE of generally smaller than 15%.104–106 The EQE of the microLEDs can be viewed as the product of two separate efﬁciencies: IQE and light extraction efﬁciency (LEE).107 While IQE is signiﬁcantly improved over the years, LEE has been a limiting factor.100,108,109 Low LEE is primarily due to the large refractive index difference between air and semiconductors that traps light from total internal reﬂection (TIR) and Fresnel loss at the interface.110 For example, the external efﬁciency could be as low as 4.3% in a typical semiconductor material with a refractive index of 2.4', 'reported a white light VLC system that used semi-polar blue microLEDs and yellow phosphors to achieve a data rate of 2.805 Gbps.128 The higher data rate and band- width of the system are attributed to the improved radiative efﬁciency of the semi-polar blue microLEDs resulting from the reduced quantum-conﬁned Stark effect (QCSE) A hybrid strategy of mixing small-sized and large-sized phos- phors can improve the non-uniformity of the system to a great extent with only a small reduction in efﬁciency However, this remains a chal- lenge as mesa dimensions shrink to smaller areas of 5 l m and below.204 Recently, GE has developed a sub-micron sized red phos- phor K2SiF6:Mn4þ (KSF) and KSF inks suitable for microLEDs that can be deposited by low-cost methods such as ink-jet printing, slot die coating, or spin coating.233 These recent developments pave the way for phosphors to be further utilized in microLED applications by over- coming challenges due to their size 3 Compound semiconductor layers Electroluminescence, which is responsible for spontaneous light emission upon the passage of electric current, dates back to 1907 when Round discovered it in silicon carbide (SiC) crystals.234 Further under- standing of materials and luminescent phenomena makes tuning of bandgap an obvious choice for the creation of light emitting diodes of different colors.235–238 Red LEDs have traditionally used AlGaInP crystals, but recent focus has shifted to indium gallium nitride (InGaN) crystals as they offer a wide spectral range from ultraviolet to infrared.239 InGaN bandgap energy can be tuned from 0.67 to 3.42 eV by changing the composition of the alloy.129,240,241 Figure 17 shows the energy bandgap of hexagonal gallium nitride (h-GaN) as a func- tion of lattice constant that is controlled by the indium (In) concentra- tion in the alloy The external quantum efﬁciency (EQE) of the microLED decreases with decreasing device size due to the increased non- radiative recombination, also known as efﬁciency droop.100 While the peak EQE of a 20 \\x02 20 lm blue microLED has been reported to be as high as 33%, AlGaInP-based red microLEDs suffer signiﬁcantly from efﬁciency droop due to high surface recombination and long carrier lifetime at smaller dimensions (<50 lm).242–244 They also suffer from poor thermal stability at high temperatures.245,246 This has resulted in a growing interest in creating red microLEDs that are based on III- nitride materials, in particular InGaN.247,248 The EQE of red InGaN FIG 16 Phosphor structure and emission spectrum (a) The crystal structure of a nar-
