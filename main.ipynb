But I warn you, if you don’t tell me that this means war, if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that Antichrist—I really believe he is Antichrist—I will have nothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my ‘faithful slave’, as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see I have frightened you—sit down and tell me all the news.\"\n","\n","It was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna Pavlovna Scherer, maid of honour and favourite of the Empress Marya Fedorovna. With these words she greeted Prince Vasili Kuragin, a man of high rank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna Pavlovna had had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering from la grippe; grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used only by the elite.\n","\n","All her invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered by a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:\n","\n","\"If you have nothing better to do, Count [or Prince], and if the prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible, I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10—Annette Scherer.\"\n","\n","\"Heavens! what a virulent attack!\" replied the prince, not in the least disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing an embroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke in that refined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, and with the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance who had grown old in society and at court. He went up to Anna Pavlovna, kissed her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head, and complacently seated himself on the sofa.\n","\n","\"First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend’s mind at rest,\" said he without altering his tone, beneath the politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be discerned.\n","\n","\"Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times like these if one has any feeling?\" said Anna Pavlovna. \"You are staying the whole evening, I hope?\"\n","\n","\"And the fete at the English ambassador’s? Today is Wednesday. I must put in an appearance there,\" said the prince. \"My daughter is coming for me to take me there.\"\n","\n","\"I thought today’s fete had been cancelled. I confess all these festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.\"\n","\n","\"If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have been put off,\" said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by force of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed.\n","\n","\"Don’t tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novosiltsev’s dispatch? You know everything.\"\n","\n","\"What can one say about it?\" replied the prince in a cold, listless tone. \"What has been decided? They have decided that Buonaparte has burnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn ours.\"\n","\n","Prince Vasili always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a stale part. Anna Pavlovna Scherer on the contrary, despite her forty years, overflowed with animation and impulsiveness. To be an enthusiast had become her social vocation and, sometimes even when she did not feel like it, she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the expectations of those who knew her. The subdued smile which, though it did not suit her faded features, always played round her lips expressed, as in a spoiled child, a continual consciousness of her charming defect, which she neither wished, nor could, nor considered it necessary, to correct.\n","\n","In the midst of a conversation on political matters Anna Pavlovna burst out:\n","\n","\"The Empress is pregnant again. Bonaparte will leave all Europe without monarchs. He evidently has conceived that the French are to be an exclusive people. Perhaps he has met his former wife and repented of his sins. To-day no one would be surprised at any change in his plans.\"\n","\n","\"Bonaparte seems to have forgotten that there are laws of political economy. Princes should always remember this. Here is a curious fact. When I was in London there were two women of rank, both of whom I knew personally, who gave birth to sons at precisely the same time. One was at the age of forty, the other at thirty. The first son was delicate, small, and weak; the second was a veritable Hercules. It was all the difference of ten years. Now if you please, the same thing holds true of Europe. Bonaparte forgets that the sovereigns who rule Europe are men like other men. And I dare say if you examined the matter, you would find that the nations that are ruled by these sovereigns are just as susceptible to diseases, to shocks, to all the influences that weaken and ruin men. And I am convinced that Bonaparte, the genius, the man who is so great a personage in his own estimation, is merely an instrument of Providence who is now wreaking vengeance upon the sovereigns of Europe. I can assure you he is no more than that.\"\n","\n","Anna Pavlovna paused in her tirade and looked at Prince Vasili with a questioning smile.\n","\n","\"Well, what do you think?\" she asked, seeing that he had not stirred a muscle. \"Is there anything in what I say?\"\"\"\n","\n","# Anna Pavlovna Scherer was maid of honour and favourite of the Empress Marya Fedorovna.

But how do you do? I see I have frightened you—sit down and tell me all the news.\"\n","\n","It was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna Pavlovna Scherer, maid of honour and favourite of the Empress Marya Fedorovna. With these words she greeted Prince Vasili Kuragin, a man of high rank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna Pavlovna had had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering from la grippe; grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used only by the elite.\n","\n","All her invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered by a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:\n","\n","\"If you have nothing better to do, Count [or Prince], and if the prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible, I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10—Annette Scherer.\"\n","\n","\"Heavens! what a virulent attack!\" replied the prince, not in the least disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing an embroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke in that refined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, and with the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance who had grown old in society and at court. He went up to Anna Pavlovna, kissed her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head, and complacently seated himself on the sofa.\n","\n","\"First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend’s mind at rest,\" said he without altering his tone, beneath the politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be discerned.\n","\n","\"Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times like these if one has any feeling?\" said Anna Pavlovna. \"You are staying the whole evening, I hope?\"\n","\n","\"And the fete at the English ambassador’s? Today is Wednesday. I must put in an appearance there,\" said the prince. \"My daughter is coming for me to take me there.\"\n","\n","\"I thought today’s fete had been cancelled. I confess all these festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.\"\n","\n","\"If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have been put off,\" said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by force of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed.\n","\n","\"Don’t tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novosiltsev’s dispatch? You know everything.\"\n","\n","\"What can one say about it?\" replied the prince in a cold, listless tone. \"What has been decided? They have decided that Buonaparte has burnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn ours.\"\n","\n","Prince Vasili always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a stale part. Anna Pavlovna Scherer on the contrary, despite her forty years, overflowed with animation and impulsiveness. To be an enthusiast had become her social vocation and, sometimes even when she did not feel like it, she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the expectations of those who knew her. The subdued smile which, though it did not suit her faded features, always played round her lips expressed, as in a spoiled child, a continual consciousness of her charming defect, which she neither wished, nor could, nor considered it necessary, to correct.\n","\n","In the midst of a conversation on political matters Anna Pavlovna burst out:\n","\n","\"The Empress is pregnant again. Bonaparte will leave all Europe without monarchs. He evidently has conceived that the French are to be an exclusive people. Perhaps he has met his former wife and repented of his sins. To-day no one would be surprised at any change in his plans.\"\n","\n","\"Bonaparte seems to have forgotten that there are laws of political economy. Princes should always remember this. Here is a curious fact. When I was in London there were two women of rank, both of whom I knew personally, who gave birth to sons at precisely the same time. One was at the age of forty, the other at thirty. The first son was delicate, small, and weak; the second was a veritable Hercules. It was all the difference of ten years. Now if you please, the same thing holds true of Europe. Bonaparte forgets that the sovereigns who rule Europe are men like other men. And I dare say if you examined the matter, you would find that the nations that are ruled by these sovereigns are just as susceptible to diseases, to shocks, to all the influences that weaken and ruin men. And I am convinced that Bonaparte, the genius, the man who is so great a personage in his own estimation, is merely an instrument of Providence who is now wreaking vengeance upon the sovereigns of Europe. I can assure you he is no more than that.\"\n","\n","Anna Pavlovna paused in her tirade and looked at Prince Vasili with a questioning smile.\n","\n","\"Well, what do you think?\" she asked, seeing that he had not stirred a muscle. \"Is there anything in what I say?\"\"\"\n","\n","summarizer = T5_Summarizer(load_online=True)\n","summary = summarizer.summarize_text(context)\n","print(summary)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"mx1GETenIlr_","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1717801014948,"user_tz":-210,"elapsed":101112,"user":{"displayName":"mohammad mohammdian","userId":"16778632015796518458"}},"outputId":"8a6d92e4-0547-4419-98d4-fbf7a18af536"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["Special tokens have been added in the vocabulary, make sure the associated word embeddings are fine-tuned or trained.\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":[": \"The Empress is pregnant again.

displays with ultra-high brightness, deeper color gamut, and longer lifetime.28–31 The high luminance, energy efﬁciency, reli- ability, low cost, and bio-compatibility of microLEDs also enable them to be used in various non-display technologies such as visible light communications (VLC), photolithography, optogenetics stimulation, light sources for structured illumination microscopy (SIM), and super- resolution imaging.22,25–27,32,33 This section focuses on the system setup and recent progress of each of these applications A Visible Light Communication (VLC) The usage of microLEDs in visible light communication (VLC) systems has been investigated both as emitter devices and as photode- tectors (PD).19–21,34 The VLC system, shown in Fig 2(c), consists of three primary components: an optical transmitter, an optical channel, and a receiver.35 The optical transmitter contains the waveform gener- ator, encoders, driver electronics, microLED emitters, and transmitter optics The optical channel allows for data transfer through air or another desired medium The receiver contains receiver optics, photo- detectors, ampliﬁers, and decoders The schematic diagram of a mea- surement setup for frequency response characterization having similar components is also shown in Fig 2(a) The lower RC values of microLEDs arising from their small size (1–100 lm) and short carrier lifetime result in a high modulation bandwidth A higher 3-dB modulation bandwidth allows a higher data rate transfer in the communication system These characteristics make microLEDs an attractive choice for optical data emitters in high-speed FIG 2 The schematic diagram of a visible light communication (VLC) system (a) The system setup to measure the frequency response of microLEDs The system consists of a vector network analyzer, a bias-tee for operating the microLED, a plastic ﬁber for coupling the light, and a photodetector (b) A plot showing improved frequency response with increasing injected current density The current is increased from 5 to 40 mA A maximum 3-dB modulation bandwidth of 756 MHz is shown in the inset at 2000 A/cm2 (c) The system setup for VLC communication data-rate characterization consists of the signal quality analyzer, 20 dB ampliﬁer, bias-tee, photodetector, and a digital oscilloscope', 'This changes the lattice constant of InGaN crystal from approximately

is still notably low because increasing indium (In) content in the alloy degrades crystal quality due to a large lattice mismatch and low-temperature growth.249 Various fabrication techniques, such as strain engineering, lower growth rates, and high growth temperatures, are required to tackle the low EQE problem facing III-nitride based red microLEDs.250 A more detailed review of the development of red microLEDs can be found in the manuscript from Iida et al.250 Apart from applications in display technologies, the development of different colored efﬁcient microLEDs is important for other applica- tions such as optogenetics The activation or suppression of different cells expressed by different proteins is highly desirable for more precise control over the neuronal activity Red-and-blue-colored microLED-based optoelectronic probes have been used to demonstrate bi-directional neuronal activity manipulation.251,252 Dual-colored microLED arrays have also been used as VLC transmitters and dem- onstrated error-free data rates of 1.79–3.35 Gbps in a dual-wavelength multiplexing scheme.253 Further work is needed to enhance the efﬁ- ciency of longer wavelength microLEDs as longer wavelengths enable deeper neural cell stimulation in optogenetics and wavelength division multiplexing in VLC systems.254,255 V OUTLOOK AND CHALLENGES As discussed in the article, MicroLED/LED technology has been incorporated into a range of applications beyond display applications MicroLEDs based on InGaN/GaN have consistently higher efﬁciencies than competing approaches even as we scale down the device dimen- sions to sub-micron size for blue, green, and red emissions The efﬁ- ciency of the red-colored InGaN/GaN microLEDs can stand further improvement, especially at smaller dimensions The ability to achieve RGB emission from a single material stack will open a wide array of applications with increasingly complex system integration Additionally, the relatively high cost of GaN epi wafers remains a chal- lenge to be addressed, as microLED technology is adopted into a greater number of applications such as point-of-care medical applica- tions like phototherapy and skin treatments.256,257 The adoption of microLEDs in visible light communication (VLC) systems has rapidly grown with improved data transfer rates An increase in the modulation bandwidth is the driving factor for the higher data transfer rates Device miniaturization and the decrease in carrier lifetime of microLEDs can further improve this trend Additionally, VLC systems that use an array of microLEDs as emitters have the potential to enhance the data transfer rates even higher, albeit with the increased system complexity Implementation of VLC in lab- oratory setup is routinely demonstrated, but the real-life system still remains a challenge Many critical issues such as reliability, scalability, and compactness related to the commercialization of the VLC systems remain to be addressed As optogenetics advances our understanding of neural circuits, microLEDs will have an increasingly prevalent role in delivering spa- tially resolved single-neuron stimulation', 'OPTICAL STRUCTURES FOR IMPROVED PERFORMANCE Despite the superior performance of microLEDs when compared with OLEDs, modiﬁcation in the key properties of microLEDs is often required for non-display applications Electro-optical components such as photonic crystals, nanostructures, microlenses, Fresnel lenses, quantum dots, phosphors, etc., are integrated with the traditional microLEDs to improve the output performance Key optical compo- nents that can enhance the performance metrics of microLEDs and make them more suitable for use in non-display applications are dis- cussed in Secs IVA–V A Extraction efficiency enhancement The low extraction efﬁciency of microLEDs originates from the traditionally grown epilayer structure of the GaN LEDs.6,106,144 A typi- cal GaN epi structure is grown hetero-epitaxially on a sapphire sub- strate due to the lack of availability of a suitable substrate for homoepitaxial growth.145,146 The photons generated inside the GaN FIG 9 A graph showing the 3-dB modulation bandwidth of microLEDs as a func- tion of current density for different pixel sizes ranging from 60 to 160 lm The mod- ulation bandwidth initially increases as the current density of

of the extracted light.147 Researchers have suggested methods including chip shaping, photonic crystals, surface roughness, and mesa shape modiﬁcation to improve the extraction efﬁciency of microLEDs.148–152 This section discusses the techniques for extraction efﬁciency enhancement in the context of various non-display applications 1 Photonic crystals Photonic crystals (PhCs) are repeated dielectric structures of length scales similar to the wavelength of light.148,153,154 These crystals have the capability to modify spontaneous light emission by creating a photonic bandgap that can interact with the electronic bandgap of the emission material.155 The photonic bandgap can be utilized in two ways to increase the extraction efﬁciency: inhibiting the emission of the guided modes or redirecting trapped light into radiated modes The photonic crystals should be physically very close to the active light emitting region to maximize their impact Wierer et al demonstrated electrically operated InGaN/GaN LEDs with photonic crystals having a tunnel junction to provide lateral current spreading to the photonics crystals.154 This work reports increased microLED radiance

quantum efﬁciencies (IQEs) that can exceed ninety percent as a result of advances in growth techniques that have yielded high-quality materials and crystal structures.100–103 However, the external quantum efﬁciency (EQE) of GaN-based microLEDs, deﬁned as the ratio of the number of photons emitted vs the number of photons internally generated, is comparatively low with a peak EQE of generally smaller than 15%.104–106 The EQE of the microLEDs can be viewed as the product of two separate efﬁciencies: IQE and light extraction efﬁciency (LEE).107 While IQE is signiﬁcantly improved over the years, LEE has been a limiting factor.100,108,109 Low LEE is primarily due to the large refractive index difference between air and semiconductors that traps light from total internal reﬂection (TIR) and Fresnel loss at the interface.110 For example, the external efﬁciency could be as low as 4.3% in a typical semiconductor material with a refractive index of 2.4', 'reported a white light VLC system that used semi-polar blue microLEDs and yellow phosphors to achieve a data rate of 2.805 Gbps.128 The higher data rate and band- width of the system are attributed to the improved radiative efﬁciency of the semi-polar blue microLEDs resulting from the reduced quantum-conﬁned Stark effect (QCSE) A hybrid strategy of mixing small-sized and large-sized phos- phors can improve the non-uniformity of the system to a great extent with only a small reduction in efﬁciency However, this remains a chal- lenge as mesa dimensions shrink to smaller areas of 5 l m and below.204 Recently, GE has developed a sub-micron sized red phos- phor K2SiF6:Mn4þ (KSF) and KSF inks suitable for microLEDs that can be deposited by low-cost methods such as ink-jet printing, slot die coating, or spin coating.233 These recent developments pave the way for phosphors to be further utilized in microLED applications by over- coming challenges due to their size 3 Compound semiconductor layers Electroluminescence, which is responsible for spontaneous light emission upon the passage of electric current, dates back to 1907 when Round discovered it in silicon carbide (SiC) crystals.234 Further under- standing of materials and luminescent phenomena makes tuning of bandgap an obvious choice for the creation of light emitting diodes of different colors.235–238 Red LEDs have traditionally used AlGaInP crystals, but recent focus has shifted to indium gallium nitride (InGaN) crystals as they offer a wide spectral range from ultraviolet to infrared.239 InGaN bandgap energy can be tuned from 0.67 to 3.42 eV by changing the composition of the alloy.129,240,241 Figure 17 shows the energy bandgap of hexagonal gallium nitride (h-GaN) as a func- tion of lattice constant that is controlled by the indium (In) concentra- tion in the alloy The external quantum efﬁciency (EQE) of the microLED decreases with decreasing device size due to the increased non- radiative recombination, also known as efﬁciency droop.100 While the peak EQE of a 20 \\x02 20 lm blue microLED has been reported to be as high as 33%, AlGaInP-based red microLEDs suffer signiﬁcantly from efﬁciency droop due to high surface recombination and long carrier lifetime at smaller dimensions (<50 lm).242–244 They also suffer from poor thermal stability at high temperatures.245,246 This has resulted in a growing interest in creating red microLEDs that are based on III- nitride materials, in particular InGaN.247,248 The EQE of red InGaN FIG 16 Phosphor structure and emission spectrum (a) The crystal structure of a nar-

displays with ultra-high brightness, deeper color gamut, and longer lifetime.28–31 The high luminance, energy efﬁciency, reli- ability, low cost, and bio-compatibility of microLEDs also enable them to be used in various non-display technologies such as visible light communications (VLC), photolithography, optogenetics stimulation, light sources for structured illumination microscopy (SIM), and super- resolution imaging.22,25–27,32,33 This section focuses on the system setup and recent progress of each of these applications A Visible Light Communication (VLC) The usage of microLEDs in visible light communication (VLC) systems has been investigated both as emitter devices and as photode- tectors (PD).19–21,34 The VLC system, shown in Fig 2(c), consists of three primary components: an optical transmitter, an optical channel, and a receiver.35 The optical transmitter contains the waveform gener- ator, encoders, driver electronics, microLED emitters, and transmitter optics The optical channel allows for data transfer through air or another desired medium The receiver contains receiver optics, photo- detectors, ampliﬁers, and decoders The schematic diagram of a mea- surement setup for frequency response characterization having similar components is also shown in Fig 2(a) The lower RC values of microLEDs arising from their small size (1–100 lm) and short carrier lifetime result in a high modulation bandwidth A higher 3-dB modulation bandwidth allows a higher data rate transfer in the communication system These characteristics make microLEDs an attractive choice for optical data emitters in high-speed FIG 2 The schematic diagram of a visible light communication (VLC) system (a) The system setup to measure the frequency response of microLEDs The system consists of

is still notably low because increasing indium (In) content in the alloy degrades crystal quality due to a large lattice mismatch and low-temperature growth.249 Various fabrication techniques, such as strain engineering, lower growth rates, and high growth temperatures, are required to tackle the low EQE problem facing III-nitride based red microLEDs.250 A more detailed review of the development of red microLEDs can be found in the manuscript from Iida et al.250 Apart from applications in display technologies, the development of different colored efﬁcient microLEDs is important for other applica- tions such as optogenetics The activation or suppression of different cells expressed by different proteins is highly desirable for more precise control over the neuronal activity Red-and-blue-colored microLED-based optoelectronic probes have been used to demonstrate bi-directional neuronal activity manipulation.251,252 Dual-colored microLED arrays have also been used as VLC transmitters and dem- onstrated error-free data rates of 1.79–3.35 Gbps in a dual-wavelength multiplexing scheme.253 Further work is needed to enhance the efﬁ- ciency of longer wavelength microLEDs as longer wavelengths enable deeper neural cell stimulation in optogenetics and wavelength division multiplexing in VLC systems.254,255 V OUTLOOK AND CHALLENGES As discussed in the article, MicroLED/LED technology has been incorporated into a range of applications beyond display applications MicroLEDs based on InGaN/GaN have consistently higher efﬁciencies than competing approaches even as we scale down the device dimen- sions to sub-micron size for blue, green, and red emissions The efﬁ- ciency of the red-colored InGaN/GaN microLEDs can stand further improvement, especially at smaller dimensions The ability to achieve RGB emission from a single material stack will open a wide array of applications with increasingly complex system integration Additionally, the relatively high cost of GaN epi wafers remains a chal- lenge to be addressed, as microLED technology is adopted into a greater number of applications such as point-of-care medical applica- tions like phototherapy and skin treatments.256,257 The adoption of microLEDs in visible light communication (VLC) systems has rapidly grown with improved data transfer rates An increase in the modulation bandwidth is the driving factor for the higher data transfer rates Device miniaturization and the decrease in carrier lifetime of microLEDs can further improve this trend Additionally, VLC systems that use an array of microLEDs as emitters have the potential to enhance the data transfer rates even higher, albeit with the increased system complexity Implementation of VLC in lab- oratory setup is routinely demonstrated, but the real-life system still remains a challenge Many critical issues such as reliability, scalability, and compactness related to the commercialization of the VLC systems remain to be addressed As optogenetics advances our understanding of neural circuits, microLEDs will have an increasingly prevalent role in delivering spa- tially resolved single-neuron stimulation', 'OPTICAL STRUCTURES FOR IMPROVED PERFORMANCE Despite the superior performance of microLEDs when compared with OLEDs, modiﬁcation in the key properties of microLEDs is often required for non-display applications Electro-optical components such as photonic crystals, nanostructures, microlenses, Fresnel lenses, quantum dots, phosphors, etc., are integrated with the traditional microLEDs to improve the output performance Key optical compo- nents that can enhance the performance metrics of microLEDs and make them more suitable for use in non-display applications are dis- cussed in Secs IVA–V A Extraction efficiency enhancement The low extraction efﬁciency of microLEDs originates from the traditionally grown epilayer structure of the GaN LEDs.6,106,144 A typi- cal GaN epi structure is grown hetero-epitaxially on a sapphire sub- strate due to the lack of availability of a suitable substrate for homoepitaxial growth.145,146 The photons generated inside the GaN FIG 9 A graph showing the

of the extracted light.147 Researchers have suggested methods including chip shaping, photonic crystals, surface roughness, and mesa shape modiﬁcation to improve the extraction efﬁciency of microLEDs.148–152 This section discusses the techniques for extraction efﬁciency enhancement in the context of various non-display applications 1 Photonic crystals Photonic crystals (PhCs) are repeated dielectric structures of length scales similar to the wavelength of light.148,153,154 These crystals have the capability to modify spontaneous light emission by creating a photonic bandgap that can interact with the electronic bandgap of the emission material.155 The photonic bandgap can be utilized in two ways to increase the extraction efﬁciency: inhibiting the emission of the guided modes or redirecting trapped light into radiated modes The photonic crystals should be physically very close to the active light emitting region to maximize their impact Wierer et al demonstrated electrically operated InGaN/GaN LEDs with photonic crystals having a tunnel junction to provide lateral current spreading to the photonics crystals.154 This work reports increased microLED radiance and an approximately 1.5x total increase in light extraction with photonic crystals incorporation Additionally, the far-ﬁeld radiation pattern of LEDs with PhC was also radically different than planar

surface recombination and long carrier lifetime at smaller dimensions (<50 lm).242–244 They also suffer from poor thermal stability at high temperatures.245,246 This has resulted in a growing interest

displays with ultra-high brightness, deeper color gamut, and longer lifetime.28–31 The high luminance, energy efﬁciency, reli- ability, low cost, and bio-compatibility of microLEDs also enable them to be used in various non-display technologies such as visible light communications (VLC), photolithography, optogenetics stimulation, light sources for structured illumination microscopy (SIM), and super- resolution imaging.22,25–27,32,33 This section focuses on the system setup and recent progress of each of these applications A Visible Light Communication (VLC) The usage of microLEDs in visible light communication (VLC) systems has been investigated both as emitter devices and as photode- tectors (PD).19–21,34 The VLC system, shown in Fig 2(c), consists of three primary components: an optical transmitter, an optical channel, and a receiver.35 The optical transmitter contains the waveform gener- ator, encoders, driver electronics, microLED emitters, and transmitter optics The optical channel allows for data transfer through air or another desired medium The receiver contains receiver optics, photo- detectors, ampliﬁers, and decoders The schematic diagram of a mea- surement setup for frequency response characterization having similar components is also shown in Fig 2(a) The lower RC values of microLEDs arising from their small size (1–100 lm) and short carrier lifetime result in a high modulation bandwidth A higher 3-dB modulation bandwidth allows a higher data rate transfer in the communication system These characteristics make microLEDs an attractive choice for optical data emitters in high-speed FIG 2 The schematic diagram of a visible light communication (VLC) system (a) The system setup to measure the frequency response of microLEDs The system consists of

is still notably low because increasing indium (In) content in the alloy degrades crystal quality due to a large lattice mismatch and low-temperature growth.249 Various fabrication techniques, such as strain engineering, lower growth rates, and high growth temperatures, are required to tackle the low EQE problem facing III-nitride based red microLEDs.250 A more detailed review of the development of red microLEDs can be found in the manuscript from Iida et al.250 Apart from applications in display technologies, the development of different colored efﬁcient microLEDs is important for other applica- tions such as optogenetics The activation or suppression of different cells expressed by different proteins is highly desirable for more precise control over the neuronal activity Red-and-blue-colored microLED-based optoelectronic probes have been used to demonstrate bi-directional neuronal activity manipulation.251,252 Dual-colored microLED arrays have also been used as VLC transmitters and dem- onstrated error-free data rates of 1.79–3.35 Gbps in a dual-wavelength multiplexing scheme.253 Further work is needed to enhance the efﬁ- ciency of longer wavelength microLEDs as longer wavelengths enable deeper neural cell stimulation in optogenetics and wavelength division multiplexing in VLC systems.254,255 V OUTLOOK AND CHALLENGES As discussed in the article, MicroLED/LED technology has been incorporated into a range of applications beyond display applications MicroLEDs based on InGaN/GaN have consistently higher efﬁciencies than competing approaches even as we scale down the device dimen- sions to sub-micron size for blue, green, and red emissions The efﬁ- ciency of the red-colored InGaN/GaN microLEDs can stand further improvement, especially at smaller dimensions The ability to achieve RGB emission from a single material stack will open a wide array of applications with increasingly complex system integration Additionally, the relatively high cost of GaN epi wafers remains a chal- lenge to be addressed, as microLED technology is adopted into a greater number of applications such as point-of-care medical applica- tions like phototherapy and skin treatments.256,257 The adoption of microLEDs in visible light communication (VLC) systems has rapidly grown with improved data transfer rates An increase in the modulation bandwidth is the driving factor for the higher data transfer rates Device miniaturization and the decrease in carrier lifetime of microLEDs can further improve this trend Additionally, VLC systems that use an array of microLEDs as emitters have the potential to enhance the data transfer rates even higher, albeit with the increased system complexity Implementation of VLC in lab- oratory setup is routinely demonstrated, but the real-life system still remains a challenge Many critical issues such as reliability, scalability, and compactness related to the commercialization of the VLC systems remain to be addressed As optogenetics advances our understanding of neural circuits, microLEDs will have an increasingly prevalent role in delivering spa- tially resolved single-neuron stimulation', 'OPTICAL STRUCTURES FOR IMPROVED PERFORMANCE Despite the superior performance of microLEDs when compared with OLEDs, modiﬁcation in the key properties of microLEDs is often required for non-display applications Electro-optical components such as photonic crystals, nanostructures, microlenses, Fresnel lenses, quantum dots, phosphors, etc., are integrated with the traditional microLEDs to improve the output performance Key optical compo- nents that can enhance the performance metrics of microLEDs and make them more suitable for use in non-display applications are dis- cussed in Secs IVA–V A Extraction efficiency enhancement The low extraction efﬁciency of microLEDs originates from the traditionally grown epilayer structure of the GaN LEDs.6,106,144 A typi- cal GaN epi structure is grown hetero-epitaxially on a sapphire sub- strate due to the lack of availability of a suitable substrate for homoepitaxial growth.145,146 The photons generated inside the GaN FIG 9 A graph showing the 3-dB modulation bandwidth of microLEDs as a func- tion of current density for different pixel sizes ranging from 60 to 160 lm The mod- ulation bandwidth initially increases as the current density of

of the extracted light.147 Researchers have suggested methods including chip shaping, photonic crystals, surface roughness, and mesa shape modiﬁcation to improve the extraction efﬁciency of microLEDs.148–152 This section discusses the techniques for extraction efﬁciency enhancement in the context of various non-display applications 1 Photonic crystals Photonic crystals (PhCs) are repeated dielectric structures of length scales similar to the wavelength of light.148,153,154 These crystals have the capability to modify spontaneous light emission by creating a photonic bandgap that can interact with the electronic bandgap of the emission material.155 The photonic bandgap can be utilized in two ways to increase the extraction efﬁciency: inhibiting the emission of the guided modes or redirecting trapped light into radiated modes The photonic crystals should be physically very close to the active light emitting region to maximize their impact Wierer et al demonstrated electrically operated InGaN/GaN LEDs with photonic crystals having a tunnel junction to provide lateral current spreading to the photonics crystals.154 This work reports increased microLED radiance and an approximately 1.5x total increase in light extraction with photonic crystals incorporation Additionally, the far-ﬁeld radiation pattern of LEDs with PhC was also radically different than planar LEDs.154 Oder et al demonstrated extraction efﬁciency enhancement of 63% in InGaN/GaN blue (460 nm) microLEDs and 95% in AlInGaN/ GaN UV (340 nm) microLEDs', 'further advanced the tech- nique by combining a CMOS-controlled microLED array with a projection system and translation stage to achieve written features as small as 8 lm.27 Building further on the same setup, Guilhabert et al reported mask-fee direct pattern writing with features as small as 500 nm by primarily modifying the projection optics.96 They also showed the fabrication of InGaN micro-LEDs using the same setup Recently, Wu

diodes (OLEDs) for key properties such as brightness, response time, and lifetime Table II summarizes the performance comparison between the microLEDs and OLED technology.99 Many of the metrics, such as superior brightness, reliability, and lifetime, make microLEDs well-suited to both display and non-display, but some of the key performance metrics for non-display applications dif- fer from those for display applications This section discusses the key performance parameters of microLEDs that must be optimized or enhanced for non-display applications These metrics include optical extraction,

quantum efﬁciencies (IQEs) that can exceed ninety percent as a result of advances in growth techniques that have yielded high-quality materials and crystal structures.100–103 However, the external quantum efﬁciency (EQE) of GaN-based microLEDs, deﬁned as the ratio of the number of photons emitted vs the number of photons internally generated, is comparatively low with a peak EQE of generally smaller than 15%.104–106 The EQE of the microLEDs can be viewed as the product of two separate efﬁciencies: IQE and light extraction efﬁciency (LEE).107 While IQE is signiﬁcantly improved over the years, LEE has been a limiting factor.100,108,109 Low LEE is primarily due to the large refractive index difference between air and semiconductors that traps light from total internal reﬂection (TIR) and Fresnel loss at the interface.110 For example, the external efﬁciency could be as low as 4.3% in a typical semiconductor material with a refractive index of 2.4', 'reported a white light VLC system that used semi-polar blue microLEDs and yellow phosphors to achieve a data rate of 2.805 Gbps.128 The higher data rate and band- width of the system are attributed to the improved radiative efﬁciency of the semi-polar blue microLEDs resulting from the reduced quantum-conﬁned Stark effect (QCSE) A hybrid strategy of mixing small-sized and large-sized phos- phors can improve the non-uniformity of the system to a great extent with only a small reduction in efﬁciency However, this remains a chal- lenge as mesa dimensions shrink to smaller areas of 5 l m and below.204 Recently, GE has developed a sub-micron sized red phos- phor K2SiF6:Mn4þ (KSF) and KSF inks suitable for microLEDs that can be deposited by low-cost methods such as ink-jet printing, slot die coating, or spin coating.233 These recent developments pave the way for phosphors to be further utilized in microLED applications by over- coming challenges due to their size 3 Compound semiconductor layers

is still notably low because increasing indium (In) content in the alloy degrades crystal quality due to a large lattice mismatch and low-temperature growth.249 Various fabrication techniques, such as strain engineering, lower growth rates, and high growth temperatures, are required to tackle the low EQE problem facing III-nitride based red microLEDs.250 A more detailed review of the development of red microLEDs can be found in the manuscript from Iida et al.250 Apart from applications in display technologies, the development of different colored efﬁcient microLEDs is important for other applica- tions such as optogenetics The activation or suppression of different cells expressed by different proteins is highly desirable for more precise control over the neuronal activity Red-and-blue-colored microLED-based optoelectronic probes have been used to demonstrate bi-directional neuronal activity manipulation.251,252 Dual-colored microLED arrays have also been used as VLC transmitters and dem- onstrated error-free data rates of 1.79–3.35 Gbps in a dual-wavelength multiplexing scheme.253 Further work is needed to enhance the efﬁ- ciency of longer wavelength microLEDs as longer wavelengths enable deeper neural cell stimulation in optogenetics and wavelength division multiplexing in VLC systems.254,255 V OUTLOOK AND CHALLENGES As discussed in the article, MicroLED/LED technology has been incorporated into a range of applications beyond display applications MicroLEDs based on InGaN/GaN have consistently higher efﬁciencies than competing approaches even as we scale down the device dimen- sions to sub-micron size for blue, green, and red emissions The efﬁ- ciency of the red-colored InGaN/GaN microLEDs can stand further improvement, especially at smaller dimensions The ability to achieve RGB emission from a single material stack will open a wide array of applications with increasingly complex system integration Additionally, the relatively high cost of GaN epi wafers remains a chal- lenge to be addressed, as microLED technology is adopted into a greater number of applications such as point-of-care medical applica- tions like phototherapy and skin treatments.256,257 The adoption of microLEDs in visible light communication (VLC) systems has rapidly grown with improved data transfer rates An increase in the modulation bandwidth is the driving factor for the higher data transfer rates Device miniaturization and the decrease in carrier lifetime of microLEDs can further improve this trend Additionally, VLC systems that use an array of microLEDs as emitters have the potential to enhance the data transfer rates even higher, albeit with the increased system complexity Implementation of VLC in lab- oratory setup is routinely demonstrated, but the real-life system still remains a challenge Many critical issues such as reliability, scalability, and compactness related to the commercialization of the VLC systems remain to be addressed As optogenetics advances our understanding of neural circuits, microLEDs will have an increasingly prevalent role in delivering spa- tially resolved single-neuron stimulation', 'OPTICAL STRUCTURES FOR IMPROVED PERFORMANCE Despite the superior performance of microLEDs when compared with OLEDs, modiﬁcation in the key properties of microLEDs is often required for non-display applications Electro-optical components such as photonic crystals, nanostructures, microlenses, Fresnel lenses, quantum dots, phosphors, etc., are integrated with the traditional microLEDs to improve the output performance Key optical compo- nents that can enhance the performance metrics of microLEDs and make them more suitable for use in non-display applications are dis- cussed in Secs IVA–V A

of the extracted light.147 Researchers have suggested methods including chip shaping, photonic crystals, surface roughness, and mesa shape modiﬁcation to improve the extraction efﬁciency of microLEDs.148–152 This section discusses the techniques for extraction efﬁciency enhancement in the context of various non-display applications 1 Photonic crystals Photonic crystals (PhCs) are repeated dielectric structures of length scales similar to the wavelength of light.148,153,154 These crystals have the capability to modify spontaneous light emission by creating a photonic bandgap that can interact with the electronic bandgap of the emission material.155 The photonic bandgap can be utilized in two ways to increase the extraction efﬁciency: inhibiting the emission of the guided modes or redirecting trapped light into radiated modes The photonic crystals should be physically very close to the active light emitting region to maximize their impact Wierer et al demonstrated electrically operated InGaN/GaN LEDs with photonic crystals having a tunnel junction to provide lateral current spreading to the photonics crystals.154 This work reports increased microLED radiance and an approximately 1.5x total increase in light extraction with photonic crystals incorporation Additionally, the far-ﬁeld radiation pattern of LEDs with PhC was also radically different than planar LEDs.154 Oder et al demonstrated extraction efﬁciency enhancement of 63% in InGaN/GaN blue (460 nm) microLEDs and 95% in AlInGaN/ GaN UV (340 nm) microLEDs', 'further advanced the tech- nique by

diodes (OLEDs) for key properties such as brightness, response time, and lifetime Table II summarizes the performance comparison between the microLEDs and OLED technology.99 Many of the metrics, such as superior brightness, reliability, and lifetime, make microLEDs well-suited to both display and non-display, but some of the key performance metrics for non-display applications dif- fer from those for display applications This section discusses the key performance parameters of microLEDs that must be optimized or enhanced for non-display applications These metrics include optical extraction,

quantum efﬁciencies (IQEs) that can exceed ninety percent as a result of advances in growth techniques that have yielded high-quality materials and crystal structures.100–103 However, the external quantum efﬁciency (EQE) of GaN-based microLEDs, deﬁned as the ratio of the number of photons emitted vs the number of photons internally generated, is comparatively low with a peak EQE of generally smaller than 15%.104–106 The EQE of the microLEDs can be viewed as the product of two separate efﬁciencies: IQE and light extraction efﬁciency (LEE).107 While IQE is signiﬁcantly improved over the years, LEE has been a limiting factor.100,108,109 Low LEE is primarily due to the large refractive index difference between air and semiconductors that traps light from total internal reﬂection (TIR) and Fresnel loss at the interface.110 For example, the external efﬁciency could be as low as 4.3% in a typical semiconductor material with a refractive index of 2.4', 'reported a white light VLC system that used semi-polar blue microLEDs and yellow phosphors to achieve a data rate of 2.805 Gbps.128 The higher data rate and band- width of the system are attributed to the improved radiative efﬁciency of the semi-polar blue microLEDs resulting from the reduced quantum-conﬁned Stark effect (QCSE) A hybrid strategy of mixing small-sized and large-sized phos- phors can improve the non-uniformity of the system to a great extent with only a small reduction in efﬁciency However, this remains a chal- lenge as mesa dimensions shrink to smaller areas of 5 l m and below.204 Recently, GE has developed a sub-micron sized red phos- phor K2SiF6:Mn4þ (KSF) and KSF inks suitable for microLEDs that can be deposited by low-cost methods such as ink-jet printing, slot die coating, or spin coating.233 These recent developments pave the way for phosphors to be further utilized in microLED applications by over- coming challenges due to their size 3 Compound semiconductor layers Electroluminescence, which is responsible for spontaneous light emission upon the passage of electric current, dates back to 1907 when Round discovered it in silicon carbide (SiC) crystals.234 Further under- standing of materials and luminescent phenomena makes tuning of bandgap an obvious choice for the creation of light emitting diodes of different colors.235–238 Red LEDs have traditionally used AlGaInP crystals, but recent focus has shifted to indium gallium nitride (InGaN) crystals as they offer a wide spectral range from ultraviolet to infrared.239 InGaN bandgap energy can be tuned from 0.67 to 3.42 eV by changing the composition of the alloy.129,240,241 Figure 17 shows the energy bandgap of hexagonal gallium nitride (h-GaN) as a func- tion of lattice constant that is controlled by the indium (In) concentra- tion in the alloy The external quantum efﬁciency (EQE) of the microLED decreases with decreasing device size due to the increased non- radiative recombination, also known as efﬁciency droop.100 While the peak EQE of a 20 \\x02 20 lm blue microLED has been reported to be as high as 33%, AlGaInP-based red microLEDs suffer signiﬁcantly from efﬁciency droop due to high surface recombination and long carrier lifetime at smaller dimensions (<50 lm).242–244 They also suffer from poor thermal stability at high temperatures.245,246 This has resulted in a growing interest in creating red microLEDs that are based on III- nitride materials, in particular InGaN.247,248 The EQE of red InGaN FIG 16 Phosphor structure and emission spectrum (a) The crystal structure of a nar-

(LEDs) based on InGaN/GaN semicon- ductors have become ubiquitous These devices are an integral part of the solid-state lighting ecosystem including automobiles, smartphones, home lighting systems, and industrial lighting.1–5 The adoption of LEDs has enabled additional functionalities in the form of longer life- time, more reliable operation, smaller form factor, and lower power consumption in almost every application Much of the effort toward cost reduction in LEDs has been focused on increasing external efﬁciency using improved material growth techniques and optimizing fabrication processes.6 The reduc- tion in high costs of GaN semiconductor-based light emitting diodes is a challenge that needs to be addressed']\n","One of the most widely anticipated applications of microLEDs is **structured illumination microscopy**. This technique allows researchers to create 3D images of biological samples by illuminating them with light patterns designed to interact with the sample's optical properties.\n"]}]}]}
